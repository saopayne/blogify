"For millions of Americans, getting the best holiday shopping deals and discounts have become as much a part of Thanksgiving as turkey, football or pumpkin pie.  Increasingly, that shopping takes place online, which provides a lot of conveniences but also raises the specter of scams, fraud or identity theft. Just as consumers have migrated towards online shopping, credit card thieves have started shifting their efforts online as well. During the holidays, deeply discounted products look appealing and shoppers make quick purchasing decisions without always taking into consideration the online purchasing risks that can be present. Many Americans have had their online accounts hacked and personal information compromised because of stolen credentials or weak logins. As hackers get more resourceful, usernames and passwords – which have been the fundamental account security mechanism – are no longer a sufficient solution to secure accounts. Luckily, there is a simple way to secure your online accounts and better protect yourself against online crime: strong authentication.

Enabling strong authentication, sometimes called multi-factor or two-factor authentication, goes beyond just a username and password and is a useful way to lock down your login. I encourage you to enable strong authentication on your sensitive online accounts such as your email, banking, and social media accounts today. Taking advantage of the strong authentication – such as a unique one-time code through an app on your mobile device, biometrics, or security keys – that are offered by the majority of popular websites and services can go a long way in protecting your personal information online.

The White House recently launched the “Lock Down Your Login” campaign to encourage all Americans to protect themselves online with strong authentication. For more information on strong authentication and the new campaign, please visit  www.LockDownYourLogin.com. You’ll find specific advice on how to turn on strong authentication on a variety of websites and services that Americans use each day.

Additionally, DHS’ Stop.Think.Connect. campaign has a number of tips and resources to help consumers protect themselves when shopping online.  In addition to using strong authentication whenever possible, consumers should:

"The mission of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is to safeguard the American people, our homeland, and our values.  As a Department, we work to combat the heinous crime of human trafficking each day because it robs people of their freedom; it makes our homeland less secure; and it stands in stark contrast to our American values.

By Presidential Proclamation, January is National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month. DHS employees can take a stand against human trafficking by recommitting ourselves to the fight to end human trafficking in the United States. But you don’t have to be a homeland security professional to combat human trafficking.  This January, learn how to recognize the signs of human trafficking, and where to report suspected instances. We need you to help end trafficking in your community.

January 11 is the Blue Campaign’s ""Wear Blue Day"", a day where we can all pledge our solidarity with victims of human trafficking and raise awareness about, and work to end, this heinous crime.  You can participate by wearing blue and contributing to the campaign on social media using #WearBlueDay.   Help us bring trafficking out of the shadows and into plain sight.

DHS created the Blue Campaign in 2010 to serve as the Department’s unified voice to combat human trafficking. By prioritizing the fight against human trafficking and improving our coordination across the Department on this important issue, we embarked on a concerted effort to raise public consciousness of human trafficking, protect victims, and bring perpetrators to justice.  Please join us in this important fight.",tsa
"The mission of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is to safeguard the American people, our homeland, and our values. That means preventing terrorism, securing our border, managing our immigration system, safeguarding cyberspace, and ensuring resilience to disasters.  But it also means fighting human trafficking, which is an affront to human dignity, and stands to threaten our people, our homeland, and our values.

DHS created the Blue Campaign in 2010 to serve as the Department’s unified voice to combat human trafficking. By prioritizing the fight against human trafficking and improving our coordination across the Department on this important issue, we embarked on a concerted effort to raise public consciousness of human trafficking, protect victims, and bring perpetrators to justice.

Earlier today, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson participated in the annual meeting of the President’s Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Human Trafficking (PITF) at the White House. This meeting provided an important opportunity to take stock of our efforts to combat human trafficking not only over the past year, but throughout this Administration. We know that our work to fight human trafficking is not over, but I am incredibly proud of how far we have come.

During the meeting, Secretary Johnson announced the Department’s revision to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Directive on Continued Presence. This revision will extend the duration of this important immigration designation for non-U.S. citizen victims of human trafficking from one year to two years, providing crucial stability and greater support to victims as they aid in the investigations of their traffickers. This is a part of our Department’s victim-centered approach to combating human trafficking.

This January, the Blue Campaign announced that going forward, human trafficking awareness training would be integrated into the basic training courses at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers (FLETC), ensuring that over 90 federal law enforcement agencies that participate in FLETC are equipped with the tools to recognize possible cases of human trafficking and respond appropriately.

These two examples demonstrate that a holistic approach to combating human trafficking means both protecting victims as well as equipping law enforcement with the tools and resources they need to recognize, report, and investigate human trafficking.

But our work cannot and does not end there.  Every day, DHS employees look for indicators of human trafficking in the course of their daily duties. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) employees investigate human trafficking cases, and support victims through a victim assistance program. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) employees work with airline personnel to combat human trafficking through the Blue Lightning Initiative, and ensure that products made with forced labor overseas are not able to enter our supply chain. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) works to ensure that eligible non-citizen victims of trafficking have access to badly-needed immigration designations for trafficking victims. And the Blue Campaign works to empower communities to combat human trafficking by forming partnerships, raising public awareness, and creating and disseminating free tools and resources for use across the country in combating human trafficking.

Our work is far from over. Until it is, it remains my honor to combat human trafficking alongside the dedicated women and men of DHS.

"As a transportation security specialist–explosives for TSA, I provide a critical layer of security. When our officers at the checkpoint have concerns about an item or image during screening, they call on me to provide advanced alarm resolution. This means that I’m responsible for ensuring that the item isn’t a potential bomb.

All specialists, like me, are former members of a public safety or military bomb squad. I served 14 years in the United States Army and deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan as the platoon sergeant of an explosive ordnance disposal company. In many ways, my work with TSA is a continuation of that experience.

I provide training to TSA officers on explosives and improvised explosive device detection, as well as concealment and smuggling techniques. Working in an airport is an exciting and fast paced environment. TSA officers have to be vigilant and well-prepared as they focus on their important job of preventing dangerous items from boarding an aircraft.

My mission extends beyond the airport. I work throughout central Florida conducting training, performing vulnerability assessments, and sharing information on evolving threats with our partners in the rail, bus, pipeline and maritime services.

Explosive devices are the number one threat to aviation, and terrorists are firm in their intent to do us harm. Some days, 70,000 travelers pass through my airport’s checkpoint – almost the equivalent of the entire population of my hometown. My goal is to ensure every one of them gets to their destination safely.",tsa
"Yesterday, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh C. Johnson hosted the 2016 DHS Secretary’s Awards Ceremony to honor DHS employees from across the country for their extraordinary work and commitment to the Department’s mission.

Secretary Johnson delivered remarks during this, his final Secretary’s Awards ceremony in office. Here’s what he said:

“I want to give all of the awardees in the room one more great round of applause for your terrific work.

Today is my last ceremony such as this one along with Ali the Deputy Secretary, so I cannot help but reflect on my time as Secretary - my 1,038 days as secretary - with Ali as my partner.

When we walked in the door 34 months ago - 1,038 days ago - we looked around and we recognized that we had a lot of work to do. We had a lot of work to do on the Department and focused on, as Ali likes to put it, building the Department of Homeland Security that each of you deserve.

When we walked in, there were many vacancies at senior level positions in the Department. So first order of business was filling those vacancies with many of the men and women that you see in the first two rows. And within a short period of time, we filled those vacancies with remarkably committed, talented senior leaders of this Department who have led us over the last number of years in our extraordinary homeland security mission. I’d like everyone to give your leadership team a great round of applause. Political appointees and career, it has been my honor to work with such an extraordinary leadership team.

Through our Unity of Effort initiative we have, I hope you will agree, built a better Department of Homeland Security that you deserve: through Joint Task Forces, the Joint Requirements Council, through a number of other reforms in the way that we conduct our business, and through our incredibly important mission. We are at the forefront of so many vitally important national security and homeland security missions, on the front page virtually every day. There are so many ways in which all of you are leading the effort to protect and safeguard the American people, our homeland, and our values. We’ve done a lot of things over the last 34 months.

Ali continually pointed out to me that in order to engage in reform, we’ve got to focus on the men and women of this Department. We have to focus on your work, your working conditions, and so much of our work has been on improving the pay scale, for example, for ERO, for improving the transparency of training and promotion opportunities, through the creation of our DHS-wide mission statement that binds all of you together in our collective homeland security mission, through the creation of the video that you saw at the outset of this program, and through the improvement in the morale in this Department. I am pleased that this year, we’ve raised morale across this entire Department three whole percentage points, which is regarded by OPM as statistically significant, that I hope is the beginning of our new trend upward in this Department.

We brought back this awards ceremony to acknowledge the terrific and great work and the value of the men and women of this Department which I am sure all of the awardees will agree is a reflection of the work you see among thousands of your colleagues.

Ladies and gentlemen, it has been the highlight of my professional life to lead all of you; it has been the highlight of my professional life to work with all of you. Quite frankly, much is said and written about my distinguished family, and when people talk about that, they talk about my father’s family, but not much is said about my mother’s family. My mother’s family were Washingtonians. They were all like you, federal servants who loved their country and were patriotic. And so when I look at you, I see my family. Thank you for the opportunity to work with you. Thank you.

Congratulations to the awardees today. I look forward to continuing to serve you for the remaining time in this Administration. And I hope that all of you will continue to safeguard the American people, our homeland, and our values. Thank you, congratulations, and God bless you.”",tsa
"Last week, we were honored to join almost 600 industry partners and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) leaders for a Strategic Industry Conversation event. Our industry partners are well positioned to assist the Department in solving problems, improving processes, and supporting diverse mission areas.

The Strategic Industry Conversation is not your typical “industry day” focused on specific procurements. Instead, it is a venue for DHS and industry to discuss program topics that span multiple DHS Offices and Components and impact the DHS Unity of Effort initiative.

Under Secretary for Management Russ Deyo delivered keynote remarks, during which he emphasized the Department’s commitment to working with industry to improve mission outcomes. Deputy Under Secretary for Management and Chief Financial Officer Chip Fulghum discussed how Management’s integrated priorities helped improve existing acquisitions by developing new processes where needed. Deputy Assistant Secretary for Unity of Effort Integration Drew Kuepper spoke on the Department’s Unity of Effort Integrated Priorities and how they relate to our industry engagement approach.

Nine breakout sessions, led by industry leaders and Department employees, encouraged participants to discuss various topics across the homeland security enterprise, from research and development to cybersecurity acquisitions. Vendors interested in specific mission areas (e.g., aviation security) were able to hear from, and speak with, DHS and industry leaders who are actively engaged in those mission areas.

Over the course of the day, industry provided DHS with constructive feedback on how to better communicate during all phases of the acquisition lifecycle. Our industry partners also gained greater perspective into the Department, its priorities, and how it approaches acquisition.

As the Department’s Chief Procurement Officer, I am proud to have engaged with our industry partners for a day of clear and open communication--a crucial first step in strengthening our engagements.

The Department is committed to working with our industry partners in order to reach new heights in industry‑government communication. The Strategic Industry Day was just one example.  Please join us as we work to make DHS the best partner in government.

"On Wednesday, October 26, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson presented Senator Barbara Mikulski with the Distinguished Public Service Award during a ceremony at the U.S. Secret Service James J. Rowley Training Center. The DHS Distinguished Public Service Award is the highest honor bestowed by the Secretary to recognize exceptional and transformational public service.

Representing the state of Maryland, Senator Mikulski is the longest serving woman in the history of the U.S. Senate. Her tenure in public service also includes serving on the Baltimore City Council and U.S. House of Representatives. Senator Mikulski’s leadership on homeland security and intelligence related issues has made her one of the leading congressional experts on these issues. Senator Mikulski supported the creation of the Department of Homeland Security and has since been a strong advocate for the department.

Secretary Johnson and Senator Mikulski were joined by Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas and DHS senior leadership for a tour of the training facility, including a protective operation demonstration by the Secret Service’s Counter Assault Team.

Past recipients of the DHS Distinguished Public Service Medal include former NYPD Police Commissioner Bill Bratton, former Senator Saxby Chambliss, and former Senator Joe Lieberman.",tsa
"Whether it’s an app that allows us to control the temperature in our home from miles away, a fitness band that tracks the number of steps we take and calories we consume, or a refrigerator sensor that alerts us to when we are running low on milk, apps and connected devices have transformed the way we live our lives.

These major advancements in mobile technology have resulted in an unprecedented era of convenience. On the other hand, the rapidly increasing number of connected devices Americans use on a daily basis has changed what it means to keep our digital lives and homes cyber secure. Not only are we using more apps, we’re also now sharing an extraordinary amount of personal information online, including banking and credit card information, personal health data, and our addresses or location information.  One of the biggest challenges of our time is creating a more secure digital environment by raising awareness for cybersecurity and the critical need to protect personal data online and make more informed decisions on when to share that data at all.

As part of National Cybersecurity Awareness Month 2016 and throughout the year, the Department of Homeland Security is encouraging all Americans to take simple measures to protect their personal information online. Get started by following these steps to help ensure the security of your sensitive information.

One group that has a high ‘app’-titude are children and students. Our Nation’s youth have never known a world that was not digitally connected. They are comfortable with technology, and they may have a different concept of privacy than adults. Parents and educators have a responsibility to help children understand safe online behavior and that online actions have real world consequences. One way to do this is to start ongoing conversations with children about their online actions. DHS’ Stop.Think.Connect.™ Campaign has resources for parents and educators. For students that want to take their cyber skills knowledge and one day work in the cybersecurity field, encourage them to visit www.dhs.gov/cyber. There they will learn about what a cybersecurity job in the government can look like and locate scholarship and job opportunities through the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

National Cyber Security Awareness Month is led by the Stop.Think.Connect.™ Campaign, the nation’s cybersecurity public awareness campaign, in partnership with the National Cyber Security Alliance and the Anti-Phishing Working Group. The Stop.Think.Connect. Campaign aims to empower the American people to be more secure online by providing them with the tools and resources they need to be safe online.",tsa
"Violent extremism is an evolving threat and a complex challenge. We have seen ISIL attempt to inspire violence from afar through cyberspace. Meanwhile, events in Charleston, Baton Rouge and elsewhere show that violent extremism is not restricted to terrorism abroad and ISIL-inspired violence. As the threat has developed, so has our response.

Two weeks ago, the Administration issued strategic guidance updating the roles and responsibilities of the various departments and agencies that are working together, in partnership with local communities, to address this threat.

Today, the Department of Homeland Security released a comprehensive strategy that aligns with this guidance and builds on Secretary Johnson’s September 28, 2015 memorandum, titled “Building Community Partnerships to Counter Violent Extremism.” That memorandum gave us the strategic direction to take our CVE efforts to the next level and set up the Office for Community Partnerships, which has already developed the first federal grant program dedicated to supporting local CVE efforts.

The Department of Homeland Security Strategy for Countering Violent Extremism (285 KB PDF) recognizes the progress we have made, and lays the groundwork for the future of this critical mission. This document also acknowledges that as we develop our CVE programs, we will continue to make the appropriate privacy, civil rights and civil liberties considerations, working closely with both legal counsel and the DHS Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties.

This document notes the importance of understanding the threat we face, putting us on track to further expand our research into violent extremism and advance our programs. It underscores the importance of keeping our local partners informed on the complex nature of terrorist recruitment and radicalization to violence. Through this strategy, we will strengthen our efforts by further improving oversight and coordination, ensuring that benchmarks and measures of performance inform our work, and integrating and unifying CVE planning, programming, budgeting, and execution across the Department.

As we continue to execute this important mission, discussion and dialogue is essential to success. We remain committed to engaging communities and building the trust that is fundamental to this work. This strategy affirms that we are protecting the homeland while upholding our values.",tsa
"By the time you arrive at work or school today, you have already relied on our Nation’s critical infrastructure. From your shower and your breakfast, to your commute and morning login, these vital systems were working for you. National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD), along with our fellow DHS professionals from FEMA, TSA, Coast Guard, and other components, are on the frontlines securing and protecting critical infrastructure each and every day throughout the nation.

This November, during Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience Month, we ask you to join us in promoting awareness of the essential role critical infrastructure plays in all of our lives, and ways organizations and individuals can work to help ensure its resilience and security.

This year, Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience Month will focus on our infrastructure’s increasing reliance on web-enabled systems.

"The Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) plays an important role in the field of nuclear forensics.  In addition to advancing technical capabilities and supporting expertise development, DNDO coordinates with other partners to exercise the U.S. government’s ability to collect nuclear debris samples in the event of a detonation and transport them to laboratories for analysis.

One such exercise took place this fall.  The exercise, Prominent Hunt 16-2B, was conducted in Tampa, Florida, using the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office Walter C. Heinrich Training Center as the exercise venue.

Working in close coordination with Florida state and local agencies, DNDO and its federal partners conducted the exercise against the backdrop of a simulated detonation of a terrorist nuclear device.  The National Technical Nuclear Forensics Ground Collection Task Force, which includes members from the Department of Defense (DoD), Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration (DOE/NNSA), and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, deployed to the site of this mock detonation to practice collecting nuclear debris.

As in a real nuclear event, our federal, state and local partners deployed planes and helicopters with aerial radiation detection and mapping equipment in support of the Task Force. This equipment can determine radiation levels and assist in the collection of optimal evidence samples, while ensuring the safety of the Task Force and other responders.  Nuclear debris collected after a detonation can be analyzed using nuclear forensics techniques to help determine those responsible for the attack.

Exercises such as Prominent Hunt help support DNDO’s mission to ensure the nation’s nuclear forensics capabilities are prepared to respond to nuclear threats.",tsa
"An Orlando nightclub. A Wisconsin shopping mall. A San Bernardino, Calif., public meeting room. Crowds cheering Boston Marathon runners, or people walking along New York City sidewalks.

In just a few seconds, these became horrific scenes when terrorists used knives, guns and bombs to attack the most unsuspecting Americans, leaving many to ask: “What can I do?”

“Take a class” sounds like a trite reply, but our training has been credited with saving lives.

November is Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience Month, and I want to take a moment to highlight some of the efforts our Office of Infrastructure Protection has taken to educate and train employees of small and medium size businesses, faith-based organizations, and other venues that attract large groups of people as part of the Hometown Security initiative. DHS provides information, tools, training and resources, including training for active shooter attacks, bomb threat awareness, how to identify and report suspicious activity, and more.

It has never been easier to learn online how to identify and report suspicious behavior, what homemade bomb parts look like, or how to “run, hide, or fight” in an active shooter situation.

While we cannot prevent every attack, we do know that training can save lives. A recent Department of Justice critical incident review of the 2015 active shooter attack in San Bernardino cited active shooter training as a key reason some people survived the attack. Many recognized the active shooter situation immediately and knew to run and hide. Another example is the 2013 Boston Marathon. Hailey Harris of Cambridge, Mass., who survived the second bomb blast, credits DHS bomb prevention training with saving her life. She said she knew from the training to stay sheltered in the event of a second bomb near the first. The second bomb exploded nearby as she stayed sheltered in a restaurant encouraging others to do stay put.

I encourage all business owners to take our online training and reach out to one of our more than 100 DHS Protective Security Advisors (PSAs) across the country for more help. Respected members of the local homeland security community, PSAs help connect people with training, planning, risk assessments and other resilience activities.

At the end of the day, while we cannot eliminate all of the threats we face, we can improve our chances of surviving with training and practice.",tsa
"Food Service Specialist 2nd Class (FS2) Cheyenne Wolfe, a line chef in the Executive Dining Facility  (EDF) at DHS’s Nebraska Avenue Complex headquarters, volunteered earlier this month to represent the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) at the “Fabulous Food Show” in Cleveland, Ohio. Wolfe and fellow USCG guardsmen were on-hand to entice show attendees with their culinary expertise, as well as add potential new recruits to the USCG’s Food Services ranks.

“It was a wonderful opportunity to show what we as chefs in the Coast Guard can do, and how guardsmen can follow their career dreams while serving their nation,” Wolfe said.

A recent convert to the culinary world, Wolfe and other USCG volunteers performed a live food demonstration and had culinary samplings available to show attendees at the USCG information and recruiting booth. At the demonstration, Wolfe and her USCG culinary compatriots prepared herb injected Sous-vide turkey breast, apple cider cranberry sauce, and apple, sage, and leek bread pudding in homage to the approaching Thanksgiving holiday. At the booth, Wolfe and her USCG culinary colleagues provided samplings of such delicacies as braised turkey leg tacos with cranberry relish, sautéed Cajun shrimp on parmesan grit cakes, and glazed apple fritters with honey apple compote. “Good food works much better than free pens when trying to get people to visit your booth,” she said with a chuckle. After being a firefighter for a year on an 87’ patrol boat, Wolfe joined the USCG in 2013 and, with no culinary experience, decided to cook the following year. After completing Food Service Specialist school, Wolfe joined the USCG Cutter Healy where she attended shipboard baking school. She acquired advanced culinary training skills at Fort Lee, applied for a food service spot and was accepted at the EDF where she’s been a line chef under Head Chef Kevin Saiyasak since July. The ""Fabulous Food Show"" is one of the nation’s largest presentations of fine food, fine art, craft breweries, wineries, restaurants and purveyors all under one roof, with live demonstrations by world-renowned celebrity chefs and culinary professionals.

"The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in coordination with The University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) has concluded the third National Seminar & Tabletop Exercise for Institutions of Higher Education (NTTX).

The NTTX is a series of campus-based events to test and promote campus resilience and emergency preparedness. The series brings together higher education leaders, as well as federal, state and local government representatives to participate in workshops and work through a designed hypothetical emergency scenario. Nearly 375 leaders representing various campus functions from more than 90 institutions of higher education from across the country attended the exercise.

"When someone goes missing, the first few minutes and hours of the search are critical. A key to the success of search and rescue (SAR) teams is an aggressive, well-planned initial response. However, many times, first responders on scene in a missing person search don’t have the extensive training and development of initial search plans that specialized SAR teams have.

The Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) First Responders Group recently released a mobile app, developed with the support of SAR teams around the nation, that provides step-by-step instructions on search plans for first responders and response teams. It provides search guidance, protocols and strategies used by SAR teams around the nation.

The Lost Person Behavior mobile app was released this spring and is available to download (for a fee) from Apple iTunes, Google Play and Amazon.com. Since its release, the app has received two-five star reviews from the APCO International Application Community and has been used in actual SAR operations in Virginia.

Using data from over 150,000 missing person cases across the country, the app provides guidance, tactical briefings, investigative questions, and statistics for over 40 different scenarios. These include lost hikers, hunters, children, missing vehicles, despondent individuals, dementia patients, and climbers. It also provides guidance for snow and water incidents.

“The Lost Person Behavior app is designed to provide a step-by-step checklist for first responders as well as everyday citizens involved in search and rescue efforts,” said program manager Christine Lee. “The app incorporated the feedback from SAR teams across the country for the development a comprehensive set of data, such as what questions to ask and what resources to use. It provides the knowledge obtained from experienced SAR teams into the hands of someone who may never have had any training at all.”

The app identifies high probability areas where an individual goes missing so searchers can initiate rapid response. It also breaks down the categories of lost people with related behavior profiles and provides a checklist of questions to ask friends and family of missing individuals. Using this data, the app uses the data to provide initial search locations and has filters for ecoregion and terrain.

The Lost Person Behavior app was developed under SBIR initiatives by dbs Productions, Charlottesville, Virginia.",tsa

"The Homeland Security Academic Advisory Council (HSAAC) met in Washington D.C. on June 5, for the 12th time in its history. The HSAAC advises the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) leadership on matters of homeland security specifically related to the academic community. The Department’s continued commitment to the higher education community highlights the important work being done on college campuses across the country in defense of our nation.

During the meeting, the HSAAC Academic Subcommittee on Countering Violent Extremism presented its report to the Council. The report offered several recommendations, developed jointly by academic leaders and subject matter experts. To date, the Council has provided more than 120 recommendations to DHS across its seven subcommittees.

The Council also discussed the Campus Resilience Program and the upcoming 2017 National Seminar and Tabletop Exercise (NTTX) event. The NTTX is a two-day event at the University of Utah that will include workshop sessions, a tabletop exercise and an after-action review session on preparing participants to respond to a campus emergency. This year’s tabletop event will focus on a potential failure in campus infrastructure caused by cyber-attack. The 2016 NTTX tabletop exercise wase based on campus active shooter scenario.

"US-CERT has received multiple reports of Petya ransomware infections in many countries around the world. Ransomware is a type of malicious software that infects a computer and restricts users' access to the infected machine until a ransom is paid to unlock it. Individuals and organizations are discouraged from paying the ransom, as this does not guarantee that access will be restored. Using unpatched and unsupported software may increase the risk of spreading ransomware and other cybersecurity threats.

Petya ransomware encrypts the master boot records of infected Windows computers, making affected machines unusable. Open-source reports indicate that the ransomware exploits vulnerabilities in Server Message Block (SMB). US-CERT encourages users and administrators to review the US-CERT article on the Microsoft SMBv1 Vulnerability and the Microsoft Security Bulletin MS17-010.

Please report any ransomware incidents to the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) [link to https://www.ic3.gov/default.aspx].

"Underpinning each of the Department of Homeland Security’s diverse missions is a pledge to uphold the highest accountability standards to the American public. One marker of this commitment is the Department’s accurate and timely public reporting of our performance on our top priorities. We’re proud that DHS has been recognized once again for outstanding transparency.

A U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) report released today reviewed how six Federal agencies reported their performance on top priority goals. Of the six agencies, DHS received a rating of “outstanding,” the highest possible score. The GAO also noted that DHS was the only agency reviewed to publically publish a comprehensive set of performance measure verification data with its annual performance report.

This recognition is just DHS’s latest accolade regarding performance reporting. Thanks to tremendous teamwork and dedication by our workforce and the leadership of the Office of the Chief Financial Officer, other remarkable accomplishments include:

Every day, DHS employees across the Department work to advance our vital missions while upholding the highest standards of transparency and accountability. These recent honors confirm their efforts.

"If you are eligible to naturalize, you should seriously consider applying for citizenship. USCIS Director León Rodríguez just took that message to Dallas, where he saw firsthand last week how organizations are helping to spread the word among permanent residents.

For instance, he stopped by the local Univision station which was hosting a special call-in event. Qualified volunteers were taking questions from callers seeking more information about the naturalization process. The volunteers were able to calm nerves, dispel myths and correct misinformation.

Director Rodríguez also spoke at the New Americans Campaign’s United for Citizenship Conference, held to welcome local and national partners and encourage collaboration. He noted that with millions of permanent residents eligible to naturalize, the potential contributions of these future citizens is tremendous. He co-chairs the White House Task Force on New Americans, which is working to implement a federal immigrant and refugee integration strategy. Ultimately the goal is to strengthen our nation’s fabric and our global competitiveness.

Like all Americans, we benefit when our newest citizens have the opportunity to live up to their potential and give back to society and the economy. Back in Washington, D.C., speaking at Jewish New Year services at a temple on Monday, Director Rodríguez recalled the biblical admonition to welcome the stranger, “for you were strangers in the land of Egypt.”

During the last decade, USCIS has welcomed more than 6.6 million new Americans. We are committed to meeting aspiring citizens halfway, by educating them about the rights and responsibilities of citizenship, helping them study for the citizenship test, and, wherever possible, reducing unnecessary barriers to naturalization.

Stay tuned -- in the coming days, USCIS will be announcing new steps that will enhance the process, like accepting credit cards to pay the fee for Form N-400, Application for Naturalization. We’ll also be announcing nearly $10 million in new grants for organizations around the country that help prepare permanent residents fulfill their dreams to become citizens.

"Last month, the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) participated in the successful demonstration of a new nuclear forensics capability designed to help better identify perpetrators of terrorist nuclear attacks.  For this demonstration, led by the Department of Defense’s (DoD) Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), DNDO worked with the U.S. Air Force, the Department of Energy (DOE) National Nuclear Security Administration, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to test the DTRA nuclear prototype system Discreet Oculus.  This demonstration, known as Mighty Saber 2015, took place from July 27 to August 21.

Discreet Oculus is a research and development effort to design and deploy a ground-based system of seismic, acoustic, air pressure, radiation, light, and radio frequency wave sensors to detect signals from an urban nuclear weapon detonation.  These signals would be combined with other nuclear forensics data to help determine the characteristics of the purported weapon and shared with law enforcement partners and intelligence agencies.  Recently installed sensors in key metropolitan areas are part of a growing nationwide network to send information in real-time to a fusion center for analysis.

Following the demonstration, I joined officials from the White House, DoD, DOE, FBI, and the intelligence community, to discuss the results of this technology and plans for its implementation.  This technology will complement existing nuclear forensics capabilities that center on the collection and analysis of debris and air samples in the immediate aftermath of a nuclear detonation within the United States, in addition to existing ground- and space-based nuclear detonation detection systems.

The U. S. Government continues to develop formidable nuclear forensics capabilities in support of our policy to hold fully accountable any state, terrorist group, or other non-state actor that supports or enables terrorist efforts to obtain or use nuclear weapons.  DNDO is responsible for helping to ensure the nation’s nuclear forensics capability is ready to respond to a nuclear event.  Being prepared for the worst contingencies can help minimize the consequences for our nation, guide national responses, and deter attacks.",tsa

"In 1965, President Johnson stood on Liberty Island in the shadow of our Statue of Liberty and signed into law the Immigration and Nationality Act.  The passage of the Act marked a significant and much-needed change to our Nation’s immigration policies.  It ended an unfair quota system, prohibited discrimination based on country of origin, and officially recognized the role of our immigration system in reuniting families and attracting skilled workers from all over the world.

In 1960, I immigrated to this country with my parents and sister as political refugees from Cuba.  Seven years after the passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act, I became a naturalized United States citizen.  Now, some 43 years later, I had the privilege of administering the Oath of Allegiance to 100 new citizens in a special naturalization ceremony in the White House.  This remarkable country is like no other.

On Monday of this week, October 3, I participated in a special naturalization ceremony that celebrated the 50th Anniversary of the Immigration and Nationality Act.  The ceremony was held in the beautiful Indian Treaty Room of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building on the White House complex.  I was honored to join Cecilia Muñoz, the leader of President Obama’s Domestic Policy Council, and León Rodríguez, Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, as we welcomed 100 new citizens from 44 countries around the globe.  Renowned historian and author Taylor Branch shared with us all the meaning and significance of the Immigration and Nationality Act.

We are a nation of immigrants.  We are a nation of opportunity.  I am blessed to be a citizen of the United States.

"Today, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson delivered remarks on immigration policies and immigration reform being undertaken by the Department at the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute’s 2015 Public Policy Conference in Washington, D.C.

Secretary Johnson opened the session by speaking directly to the young people in the audience. “My real message is about—and this is for the young people here—before the program started I was down here and I met a lot of CHCI fellows, gives me a lot of hope for the future.”

Secretary Jeh Johnson meets with students from Albert Einstein High School in Washington, D.C. before speaking at the CHCI Public Policy Conference. DHS Photo/Jetta Disco.

During his remarks, Secretary Johnson discussed how leaders in this country have a distinct responsibility to communicate openly and honestly with the American people. “All of us in public office, those who aspire to public office and who command a microphone, owe the public calm, responsible dialogue and decision making. Not overheated, over-simplistic rhetoric and proposals of superficial appeal. In a democracy, the former leads to smart and sustainable policy; the latter can lead to fear, hate, suspicion, prejudice, and government overreach,” Secretary Johnson said. “These words are especially true in matters of homeland security, and they are especially true in matters of immigration policy.”

The Secretary continued, by explaining to the audience how often heated commentary on sensitive issues like immigration lead to misinformation and overheated rhetoric – and incorrect perceptions of illegal immigration among the American people.

“As a sovereign nation we must protect our borders, but building a wall across the entire Southwest Border is not the answer. Building a wall across the winding Rio Grande, through the remote desert, and in mountains 10,000 feet high is not the answer. Investing hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars, in taxpayer money in building such a wall across the entire 1,900 mile border is not the answer.”

President Obama and Secretary Johnson remain committed to fixing our broken immigration system. In his remarks, Secretary Johnson outlined a number of steps the Department has taken to do just that – and we are making progress in those areas. Read more about the Department’s immigration actions here.

“Overall, the new enforcement policies have the potential to substantially transform the U.S. deportation system, particularly within the U.S. interior.” We’re focused on criminals. We’re focused on public safety and border security. Removals in Fiscal Year 2012, as many people know, reached a high of 409,000. Fiscal Year 2013, the number went down to 368,000. Fiscal Year 2014, the number went down, removals, to 315,000. I anticipate that in Fiscal Year 2015 the number will be significantly less than that.”

We’re also promoting and increasing access to citizenship. In fact, during Citizenship Week in September, USCIS welcomed 40,000 new U.S. citizens. And this week, in recognition of the 50th Anniversary of the Immigration and Nationality Act, Deputy Secretary Mayorkas – himself a naturalized U.S. citizen - welcomed new Americans this week.

“In terms of deferred action, we continue to fight the case in Texas and defend the case. We want to offer those who have been in this country for five years, who have children, who are citizens or lawful permanent residents, and who have committed no serious crimes the opportunity to come forward and be counted. Receive a work authorization, pay taxes, and get on the books. To those who say we don’t have the authority to do this without a change in law, I say “change the law.”

Secretary Johnson also reminded members of the audience that homeland security is a balance, between liberty and security, and stated that we should and will never give up our greatest national strengths – the freedom of religion, rights to privacy, and our immigrant heritage.

”The Pope, when he was here, reminded us all in this country of the basic dignity of every migrant. In this country I firmly believe that there should be no second-class people. Everyone should have the opportunity to seek more of the American experience.”

Representative Luis Gutiérrez and Secretary Johnson confer before the Secretary’s remarks at the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute 2015 Public Policy Conference.

Prior to the Secretary’s remarks, Representative Luis Gutiérrez introduced the Secretary by telling a story about Secretary Johnson’s grandfather. The Secretary’s grandfather, Charles Johnson, was a sociologist and the first African American president of Fisk University who spent his life advocating for the advancement of civil rights for African Americans. And in his conclusion, Secretary Johnson recounted pieces of his own personal story to illustrate this point. “[My grandfather] died in 1956, he wrote a lot, you heard some of what he wrote. He never lost hope. This was a man who, in 1949, was dragged before the House Un-American Committee to deny that he was a member of the Communist Party and gave an impassioned speech about the patriotism of the African-American. Dr. Charles Johnson died in 1956 basically a second-class citizen. A man with honorary degrees from Harvard and Columbia, a sociologist, died in a train station a second-class citizen,” Secretary Johnson said. “So I say to the young people, never lose hope in your country, in your leaders; never lose faith in the code of this nation and the democracy that we are; always have hope and faith in your country and its system of government.”

During a question-and-answer session with the audience, the Secretary answered a number of questions about immigration reform and the Department’s role in these efforts.

He challenged the audience – in particularly, the young people – to work together with the Department to bring about necessary change and stressed the importance of public service. “Mario Flores, who works for me, a decorated combat veteran of the U.S. Army who’s been deployed to Afghanistan now works for me today, is a graduate of the CHCI program. Let’s give Mario a hand.” We’re proud of Mario, and the many others like him across this Department who have benefited from leadership development programs like CHCI and continue to serve their country both on and off the battlefield.

"Most of us have developed a very close relationship with our mobile devices: we carry them with us throughout the day, check them frequently, and even sleep with them nearby at night. Although mobile devices allow us to instantly connect with friends and family, to access the internet, get directions, and make purchases, this increased convenience also comes at an increased risk. Many of these online activities require us to provide personal information such as our name, email address, account number, and credit card information.

"The Department of Homeland Security, through the unified voice of the Blue Campaign, is committed to fighting the heinous crime of human trafficking. The unfortunate reality is that human trafficking occurs here in the United States and – as our public service announcement depicts – it is hidden in plain sight. After I learned about the growing human trafficking problem in North Dakota, particularly in the oil-rich Bakken region following the oil boom, I traveled to Fargo, Dickinson, New Town, and Bismarck to gain a better understanding of the situation on the ground. While there earlier this month, I engaged with federal, state, local, tribal, non-profit, and private sector stakeholders and explored meaningful ways to work together to raise awareness and fight human trafficking in this region. At Blue Campaign we believe that only through the sum of our collective efforts will we succeed in combating this terrible crime.

The Blue Campaign brings together the Department’s diverse resources and capabilities and coordinates closely with the whole community to provide training, promote public awareness, and equip the American public to recognize and report any suspected human trafficking.

Embracing a victim-centered approach to combating human trafficking is a key facet of the Department’s efforts to combat human trafficking. On Tuesday, October 6th, I met with local partners providing vital services at the YouthWorks Shelter and the YWCA Cass Clay Shelter in Fargo. From them we learned about the robust local efforts to protect vulnerable youth and support victims of crimes, as well as other at-risk populations.

On October 7th, I visited Dickinson, where I met with local stakeholders for a roundtable discussion that brought together the diverse perspectives of local law enforcement officers, city officials, victim advocates, and even a survivor of human trafficking. I heard first-hand accounts of the challenges the city of Dickinson is facing from human trafficking, and returned with a deeper understanding of the problem and how Blue Campaign can support local efforts through public awareness resources and training.

On October 8th, I met with local advocacy groups and tribal partners from the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara Nation to hear their stories and discuss the critical importance of victim-assistance efforts – particularly in tribal communities. Blue Campaign looks forward to a continued engagement with tribal partners to jointly deliver timely and effective public awareness resources to Native American communities.

On Friday, October 9th, I hosted a roundtable discussion in Bismarck. There, I met with educators, city and law enforcement leaders, and local stakeholders to discuss special vulnerabilities of youth in local schools, as well as training resources available to educators, school resource officers, and law enforcement. Later that afternoon, I joined Senator Heidi Heitkamp to visit the YouthWorks shelter in Bismarck, where we learned about local human trafficking victims, the challenges service providers face in serving such a diverse population of victims, and how the Blue Campaign can best support their efforts.

The Blue Campaign is expanding our work in the public health sector through a new partnership with the North Dakota Public Health Association. This partnership will specifically promote the Blue Campaign’s training and awareness materials throughout North Dakota’s healthcare facilities.

North Dakota Public Health Association Executive Director Maylynn Warne spoke of the importance of our new partnership, saying “The goal is to get the materials into local hospitals and work with tribal communities where there’s a disproportionate amount of members who are a part of the human trafficking ring in North Dakota. There’s a large number of American Indian women affected so we want to be able to reach out to those communities and offer resources.”

Working with our range of invaluable partners – like Senator Heitkamp in North Dakota – the Blue Campaign will continue to spread awareness of human trafficking in order to assist victims and bring their traffickers to justice.

There is much more to be done to combat human trafficking, not just in North Dakota, but in cities and communities across the nation. We can’t do this alone. I encourage you to visit www.dhs.gov/bluecampaign to learn more and see how you can get involved.",tsa
"Today, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson participated in the Homeland Security Academic Advisory Council (HSAAC) meeting.

"We are constantly connected. Even while we’re “offline” on vacation, or away from our computer or mobile devices, chances are we’re still connected in one way or another. More and more, the Internet touches almost all aspects of our daily lives.

Don’t believe it?  Think of the systems that help to keep the lights on, the water running, and transportation moving. Or the devices that track your sleep and exercise, point you to an open parking spot, or control the thermostat at your home.  All these and more depend on digital networks to function.

This rapidly expanding set of connected devices, what we often call the “Internet of Things,” promises big changes to the way we live our lives. Yet, as we enjoy the benefits of these changes, we must consider the new risks they bring as well.  Just as we lock our doors to protect our valuables, Americans must also take steps to protect our devices and information from virtual threats by properly securing all devices that are connected to the Internet.

"Recently, the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) awarded a multimillion dollar contract that will equip U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and Transportation Security Administration (TSA) frontline personnel with a new capability to detect and interdict radiological or nuclear threats.

The award is for small, wearable radiation detector devices that passively monitor the environment and alert the user when nuclear or other radioactive material is present.  Known as the Human Portable Tripwire (HPT), this device has the capability to identify the source of radiation and allow personnel to take appropriate action.  The technology can also locate the source of the detected radiation and includes communication features that allow the user to easily seek additional technical assistance from experts if needed.  These devices are a critical tool for personnel who operate in the maritime environment, at land and sea ports of entry, and within the United States.

The Human Portable Tripwire award represents a successful collaboration between CBP, USCG, TSA, and DNDO to award one contract that meets the needs of multiple DHS components.

This is also an example of the accomplishments we can achieve under the Unity of Effort initiative. From the beginning DNDO worked closely with CBP, USCG, and TSA from the proposal evaluation stage, through the testing and evaluation, to deployment planning.  Such collaborative efforts strengthen our homeland security and increase the Department’s ability to thwart potential radiological or nuclear threats.

"During Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience Month, it is important to think about how critical infrastructure is part of your daily life. Critical infrastructure plays a vital role in our national security and prosperity.

The Nation’s infrastructure includes supply lines that bring our communities goods and services like water, transportation, and fuel and communication. It also includes the digital systems that enable us to get cash from the bank, map out the best route to a destination, and power our homes. Often times  we take these benefits for granted.

Therefore, throughout November, we want to focus on the efforts that help ensure the security of the vast, interconnected network of systems, products, and services that we all depend on.

DHS works every day with our public and private partners to ensure the security and resilience of critical infrastructure. Over the last year, we have engaged with our partners across the critical infrastructure community to update and release the 2015 Sector-Specific Plans that provides strategic plans for building resilience and reducing risk. As each of the plans are updated we will share them broadly and update their status on the 2015 Sector-Specific Plans page on DHS.gov.

Visit the Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience Month webpage to learn more about critical infrastructure and why it is important to both our daily lives and our national security. DHS leads this national effort, but it takes communities, business and industry, governments at all levels, and millions of men and women working day in and day out across the Nation to “keep the lights on” in all the sectors that provide food, roads, health care, emergency response, and communications.

I urge businesses and organizations of all kinds to review and revise their plans, processes, and protective measures to ensure strong, resilient infrastructure that can withstand and recover from all hazards. We can all help manage risk to critical infrastructure by being vigilant and reporting suspicious activity.",tsa
"If you ask Vanessa Hansen why she joined the Air Force, she'd tell you she felt a need to give back to the country that provided her family with asylum from Nicaragua. She entered the United States when she was 16 years old after her father was arrested by Nicaraguan police. After naturalizing in an asylum ceremony, Hansen decided to give back to her adopted country by entering the U.S. Air Force, where she served for almost six years. She continues to serve her country in the Air Force Reserves.

Hansen has been deployed to Afghanistan three times during Operation Enduring Freedom. As a result, she spent a significant amount of time away from her children. Her son was 6 months old for her first deployment and her daughter was 7 months old for her second deployment. The time Hansen spent serving her country away from her family and her children illustrates the level of sacrifice she was willing to pay to her adopted country.

“I wanted to serve because of my feelings of patriotism to the United States. I wanted to give back to my adoptive country for everything that it did for my family and I when we were granted asylum in the United States,” she said.

Hansen spent a considerable amount of time at her favorite duty station, Hurlburt Field, in Florida. She said she couldn’t have done any of it without the support she received from her family. Her husband of 16 years and her parents were instrumental in caring for her small children while she was serving her country thousands of miles away. Hansen said, “It’s an honor to serve in the military and to defend the Constitution.”

Hansen is currently an immigration services officer. When asked what citizenship means to her, she said “honor and family.” Vanessa Hansen is yet another example of a naturalized citizen who chose to sacrifice and serve her new country, both as a solider and a USCIS employee.

We thank her for her service and honor her on this Veterans Day.",tsa
"One of the Federal Protective Service’s (FPS) missions is to protect all Americans and their ability to peacefully demonstrate and protest. This past weekend, FPS and its law enforcement partners prepared for several large, planned public gatherings taking place in Portland, Ore. at the federally-owned Terry Shrunk Plaza and the adjacent city-owned Chapman Park, where citizens were planning to express their views, including two groups with opposing ideologies.

“Portland has had a noticeable increase in demonstrations between various groups over the last year,” said Gabriel Russell, the regional director for FPS Region 10.  “Response to events involving the many different groups has required a significant reliance on our strong relationship with the Portland Police Bureau, the Multnomah County Sheriff’s Department and the Oregon State Police to ensure each group is able to voice their views safely.”

After weeks of planning for the potential of these opposing groups to confront each other in the Portland area, FPS officers and law enforcement partners were able to hold the line between the multiple demonstration groups on Sunday, June 4.  The events at the Terry Shrunk Plaza and neighboring Chapman Park escalated quickly, turning violent as agitators from both groups began crossing the lines of separation to incite a reaction from the other group.

As FPS officers and local police tried to keep the peace, demonstrators began throwing items at them.  Once the events reached a fevered pitch and violence erupted, FPS and the Portland Police Bureau took quick action to keep people safe by closing the city park and shepherding demonstrators in another direction to allow for further separation between the two main groups.  Law enforcement officers deployed flash grenades and pepper ball munitions to help disperse the crowds.  As a result of the violence and civil disobedience, FPS arrested five individuals and the Portland Police Bureau arrested nine, in addition to confiscating countless prohibited items.

“By the end of the day, all parties had dispersed, no one was seriously injured, and the public was able to exercise the freedom of speech and go home safely,” said District Commander Luis Lopez, who oversees FPS protection operations in Portland.  “Our close relationship with the local law enforcement agencies and our joint planning and training truly paid off.”

The Federal Protective Service is the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s federal law enforcement agency responsible for protecting approximately 9,000 federal buildings across the country, and the people who visit or work in those facilities.

"The Federal Protective Service (FPS) field office in New Jersey helped a little boy’s dream of becoming a federal agent come true.

Three-year-old Trent Powers has Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) – a rare and fatal disease that causes progressive weakness and ultimately affects the heart and lungs.  The average lifespan of a child suffering from this disease is mid-to-late 20s.  However, despite the physical limitations the disease will bring, Trent continues to dream big!

With the U.S. Postal Inspection Service leading the effort, more than 12 local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies from New Jersey and New York came together for a “Fed for a Day” ceremony to grant Trent his wish of becoming a federal law enforcement officer.  The ceremony was held on April 28 at the Martin Luther King Courthouse in Newark, New Jersey. Trent arrived in a motorcade – led by an FPS motorcycle escort.  Trent was honored with badges, pins, credentials, and plaques from all the participating law enforcement agencies.

FPS presented Trent with a certificate from Regional Director Anthony Levey and named him an honorary FPS special agent.  Trent also received a rare challenge coin from FPS Director Eric Patterson, a special agent lapel pin, an FPS badge in Lucite with Trent’s name engraved, and an FPS baseball hat, which Trent chose to wear throughout the entire event.

Trent’s mother, Kimberly Powers, made opening remarks and said it’s important that the public raise awareness of DMD.  She also expressed her gratitude for the outpouring of love and support from the various law enforcement agencies.

“When FPS was approached to participate in this event, everyone without hesitation wanted to make Trent’s day super special.  The smiles from the family -- and especially Trent – were all it took to touch our hearts,” said Region 2 Area Commander Alan Kirsch who coordinated FPS’ participation in the event. “We hope the time Trent spent with us will be as memorable as the time we spent with him.”

About ten employees from FPS Region 2 participated in the event along with explosive detection canine, “K9 Vee.”  Participating members of the FPS team included Alan Kirsch, Larry Shankle, Lowery Ware, Eduardo Miranda, Isaac Wright, Mark Jedra, Luis G. Garcia, Stephen Anest, and Melissa Caballero.

Other participating federal agencies included the U.S. Postal Police, Marshals Service, Secret Service, Customs and Border Protection, Drug Enforcement Agency, FBI, Homeland Security Investigations, Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Attorney’s Office, and Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.",tsa

The closed session allowed the high-level government participants to exchange views on the region in a private setting and discuss in more details the themes addressed during the two day conference.  The leaders further underscored the U.S.-Mexico partnership on efforts to improve economic and regional security, and the continued support for Central America.

The governments of the Northern Triangle demonstrated their strong commitment to promoting sustainable economic growth and improving security and governance.  A prosperous, secure Northern Triangle enables the people who call Central America home to remain and contribute to their countries’ economy and security while reducing illegal immigration to the U.S. and Mexico.

"This Veterans Day, we asked our colleagues who are both immigrants and veterans what becoming a U.S. citizen meant to them. We received a variety of responses, but a common theme was service and pride in becoming an American. Their responses and photos from past years of service are featured below.

“Becoming a U.S. citizen filled me with pride and lit a fire inside me that drove me to want to serve in gratitude for all that I was given.”

""Duty, honor, country; these three words have guided me to become the citizen-soldier I am today. U.S. citizenship opened many doors of opportunities for myself and family. I’m glad to do my part to bear true faith and allegiance. God bless America!”

“Becoming a U. S. citizen meant a lot to me as it was the first time I felt like I had freedom and gave me all the opportunity life can afford.”

“When I became a U.S. citizen it was a sense of belonging. Even though I was a Lawful Permanent Resident serving in the military, I still felt like a visitor. After becoming a U.S. citizen, this became my country. Immigrating to the U.S. and serving this great nation has been a great honor for my family and I.”

“Becoming a U.S. citizen was a proud moment because my new country accepted me. I could be what wanted regardless of my race or sex.”",tsa

"By Dr. Andy Ozment, Assistant Secretary for Cybersecurity and Communications

and Jamie Danker, National Protection and Programs Directorate Privacy Officer

Many cyber attacks can be identified—and prevented—by sharing information about unique attack attributes, also known as indicators. A cyber threat indicator might include unique attributes of a spearphishing e-mail, such as the subject line or sending computer; or it might be a specific piece of software known to contain malicious code.

As part of our efforts to further enhance information sharing, the Department of Homeland Security’s Automated Indicator Sharing (AIS) initiative connects participating organizations to a DHS-managed system that allows two-way sharing of cyber threat indicators—from the information sharing partner to DHS, and vice versa. AIS leverages DHS-led standards for machine-to-machine communication, providing a mechanism for DHS to rapidly share cyber threat indicators with other federal agencies and the private sector.

The results of this effort will allow participating organizations to submit and receive actionable cyber threat indicators in near-real-time for network defense. This information sharing initiative will also help DHS build a common, shared knowledge of current threats to better protect federal networks and help the private sector protect itself.

DHS recognizes that cybersecurity information sharing among diverse sources requires a preeminent focus on ensuring appropriate protection for individual privacy and civil liberties, so implementing necessary safeguards was a foremost consideration in designing and implementing the AIS initiative.

The Department has published its Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) for AIS, detailing all identified privacy risks as well as the protections implemented to mitigate them. For example, the PIA notes a potential risk that Personal Identifiable Information (PII) or other sensitive information could be forwarded to DHS as part of a cyber threat indicator. To address this risk, the Department implemented robust protections to minimize the risk that PII is collected, as well as steps to ensure that, when present, PII that is not necessary to understanding the cyber threat  is quickly identified, deleted, and never shared.

"The Department of Homeland Security depends on its strongest asset – its people – to fulfill its diverse and important missions. Every day, the men and women of this Department work together to ensure that our programs, operations, and other activities are running as smoothly and efficiently as possible. We’ve made great strides to improve what we do, be good stewards of taxpayer dollars, and uphold the public trust. One measure of our success in this regard is our significant reduction in the number of open recommendations from the Office of Inspector General (OIG). By implementing better practices and resolving the OIG’s recommendations, DHS has become a more responsive and effective agency.

As recognized in the OIG’s annual report summarizing some of our biggest challenges, we have made major progress in fulfilling these recommendations – and I’m proud of our dedicated employees who are on the front lines of addressing these recommendations.

Over the past few years, we have steadily reduced the number of open OIG recommendations by 65%, from a high of 1,663 in Fiscal Year 2011 to just 583 at the end of FY 2015.

Even better, DHS has reduced the number of our most complicated recommendations which are more than 6 months old by 97%, from a high of 691 in FY 2011 to only 21 at the end of FY 2015.

These accomplishments are possible in part thanks to our Unity of Effort initiative, which Secretary Johnson established in April 2014 to create a centralized process for making Department-wide decisions. Under this initiative, we have reshaped our acquisition programs, budget requests, and strategic priorities in a cohesive and unified way. Unity of Effort has become a driving force behind many of the Department’s daily operations and has made DHS greater than the sum of its parts. I believe this approach contributed to DHS earning a clean audit opinion for the third consecutive year, and has positioned DHS leaders to make more efficient and effective decisions in support of homeland security missions.

I commend the hard work and dedication of our employees across the entire Department who collaborate with our auditors to make the Department more integrated and effective. I am confident that these trends will continue and lead to even greater future success.",tsa
"One year ago today, President Obama announced a series of actions consistent with current laws to reform as much of our broken immigration system as possible. These actions are improving accountability in our immigration system, strengthening our national security and our economy, and building on our past efforts to enforce immigration laws with common sense and compassion. In an address to the nation, the President reminded us that:

The President’s immigration executive actions lives up to this tradition. And according to the Council of Economic Advisors, the President’s executive actions, if fully implemented, would boost our economic output by up to $250 billion and raise average annual wages for U.S.-born workers by 0.4 percent, or $220 in today’s dollars, over the next ten years.

Administrations of both parties have taken executive action on immigration issues for the past half century. Last November, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued new guidelines for allowing immigrants who are longstanding members of our communities -- including immigrants who were brought here as children and the parents of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents -- to request deferred action on a case-by-case basis.

Deferred action is a well-established feature of the immigration system that has been recognized by the Supreme Court and Congress.  It is a form of temporary relief that helps DHS focus its limited enforcement resources on the highest priorities for removal, like convicted criminals and recent border crossers. Though the new deferred action policies announced last year have been put on hold in the courts, we will continue to fight to implement them. That is why the Department of Justice has filed a petition seeking review from the Supreme Court of the United States to allow these policies to move forward.

In the meantime, we are moving forward on the other components of our executive actions:

The results of these actions are real and impact members of our communities every day. Today, a high school student is less afraid of coming out of the shadows to apply for and attend college. A father is less afraid that a minor traffic stop could result in his deportation. And, a worker is less afraid she will be targeted by indiscriminate raids. Over 30,000 spouses of high-skilled workers on their path to green cards are able to work -- contributing to their families, local communities, and our nation at large.

We have and will continue to reform our immigration system, to make our communities stronger and more secure. But ultimately, it is up to Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform to fix the system once and for all. We are not only a nation of laws; we are also a nation of immigrants. We must continue to live up to this tradition and the President has reiterated this throughout the past year.

To learn more about our progress over the last year, take a look here.",tsa

U.S. Department of Homeland Security

Our networks continually face threats from hackers, criminal organizations, and nation state actors. To combat this constant threat, the federal government has worked to build a strong workforce of cybersecurity professionals to secure and protect our networks.

At the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), we are committed to recruiting, training, and employing eligible veterans to meet the ever-growing cybersecurity mission. DHS has teamed up with the non-profit organization Hire Our Heroes to provide U.S. veterans with access to the Federal Virtual Training Environment (FedVTE). FedVTE is an online, on-demand training system that provides employees at all levels of government with access to courses on cybersecurity. Through FedVTE, veterans receive access to free cybersecurity training and certification prep courses that build the skills needed to be competitive for cybersecurity jobs across the country.

FedVTE offers more than 800 hours of training on topics such as ethical hacking and surveillance, risk management, and malware analysis. Course proficiency ranges from beginner to advanced levels.  Several of the available courses align with a variety of Information Technology certifications such as Network +, Security +, and Certified Information Systems Security Professional.

FedVTE is already available to federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial government employees, so veterans with an email address ending in “.gov” can register and begin taking courses simply by visiting https://niccs.us-cert.gov/training/fedvte. Veterans who are not government employees must verify their veteran status prior to receiving FedVTE registration information through https://hireourheroes.org/veterans-training/.",tsa
"Earlier this month, the Office of the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman hosted its fifth annual conference at the National Archives in Washington, D.C.  Our conference is a unique open forum where government and stakeholders engage in robust dialogue about current immigration benefits issues.  We welcomed more than 300 attendees from across the country to share their experiences and gather insights from government representatives, while hundreds more joined the conference via livestream.

This year, we continued to focus on an important theme – Government and Stakeholders Working Together to Improve Immigration Services.  In our fifth year hosting this conference I believe that now, more than ever, it is critical to bring together immigration professionals from all sectors to discuss policy and quality of adjudications issues impacting USCIS’ customers.

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson delivered keynote remarks, encouraging stakeholders to remain involved, adding: “For those of you … who want to build a better system and will build a better life here for immigrants, I say keep at it, don’t give up and don’t lose hope.”  Secretary Johnson was followed by United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) Director Rodriguez, who presented timely remarks and engaged with stakeholders during an extensive question and answer session.  He noted the vital role of the Ombudsman’s Office and announced that USCIS has adopted the Ombudsman’s recommendations to centralize adjudications of special immigration juvenile petitions into one USCIS service center.  The subsequent morning plenary offered a rare opportunity to hear directly from government decision-makers regarding planning and implementation of President Obama’s 2014 directive to take common sense steps to fix our broken immigration system through executive actions.

Stakeholders received substantive information on immigration law and policy through the various panel topics including Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), humanitarian parole, employment authorization documents, I-601A provisional Waivers, and employment-based and humanitarian hot topics. Throughout the day, participating government representatives were forthcoming with information and explanations, helping the public better understand government policy and decision-making all around.

The Ombudsman’s Office relies on its stakeholders to keep us informed of current or emerging immigration benefits issues.  During an “Ask the Experts” brown bag session, participants met members of the Ombudsman staff - including those directly handling requests for assistance and drafting policy recommendations on immigration benefits issues - and were able engage in constructive dialogue and have their questions answered.

Each year the Ombudsman’s conference emphasizes the need for good governance, which is grounded in a steadfast commitment to efficiency, transparency, and accountability.  As an office of last resort, we continue to ensure customers experience government at its best.

If you were unable to join us in person, you can watch the conference’s morning session, Employment Hot Topics- Year in Review panel, and other selected panels here.

Watch this video to see exactly what a potential refugee goes through to resettle in the U.S.:

Since the attacks in Paris, many have asked about our process for admitting Syrian refugees into this country.

I understand the anxiety that many Americans are feeling right now. And as Secretary of Homeland Security, I share with President Obama the top priority of keeping the American people safe. So let me be clear about what this process of vetting and resettling refugees looks like.

It’s important to remember, we’re focused on admitting the most vulnerable Syrians -- this means mostly women, children and families.  Second, anyone who applies for and is approved for refugee status in the United States, including Syrians, must first go through a rigorous security screening process.

And we can continue to ensure our own security, while doing our share to welcome refugees fleeing violence, looking to America as their beacon of hope and freedom.

"On Sunday, I joined Homeland Secretary Johnson in New York City with Mayor de Blasio, Police Commissioner Bratton, Fire Commissioner Nigro, and Emergency Management Commissioner Joseph Esposito to observe the New York Police Department’s active shooter training exercise. I am pleased that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) had the opportunity to help support this important exercise.

Through the outstanding work of the DHS S&T Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Explosives Division team and the NYPD Counter Terrorism Division, we helped to fund and develop the concept for the exercise, provide training, and identify new technologies that could be used in future emergencies.

S&T’s mission is to deliver cutting-edge research to produce new technologies, capabilities and threat and risk assessments to meet the critical needs of our homeland security partners. DHS S&T, through an agreement with U.S. Army Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC), co-created the Counter Terrorism Technology Evaluation Center to assist first responders with evaluating tactics, techniques, and procedures, identifying and resourcing training opportunities and researching technologies for response to an active shooter incident. This is the fifth exercise DHS has helped to plan and coordinate to support technology demonstrations and training evaluations.

This exercise allowed S&T to observe first responders using several tools that can be translated for use by DHS and other first responders. These technologies included an indoor shot detection capability, a geo-referenced graph for better situational awareness, and an interoperable communications capability developed and currently used by the U.S. Army.

The exercise included S&T, the National Protection and Programs Directorate, U.S. Secret Service, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency; the U.S. Army’s Armament Research Development and Engineering Center; the Federal Bureau of Investigation; and numerous state and local entities.

I congratulate NYC on the success of the exercise and on the impressive coordination and cooperation between the NYPD, FDNY, NYOEM, and other state and federal agencies.  S&T is proud to continue to support these active shooter exercises to ensure the safety and security of our communities.

"Last month, the Idaho National Laboratory hosted a ribbon-cutting ceremony for a newly operational radioisotope mass separator (RMS), a device that will improve the accuracy and precision of nuclear forensics analysis. The RMS is co-sponsored by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).  Representatives from DNDO, FBI, Department of Energy, U.S. Air Force Technical Applications Center, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology attended the ceremony.

Nuclear forensics supports nuclear smuggling investigations and also aids attribution of a nuclear terrorist event. In the event of a nuclear attack, or when an adversary is caught smuggling nuclear materials, it is important to determine the material’s origin and the perpetrators. These signatures are discovered in the variations of radioactive elements in the material, or its “radioisotopes.” Scientists can measure the composition of the material at the atomic level by using analytical standards and certified reference materials. The RMS produces these ultra-purified radioisotope comparison standards, which will help advance the nation’s nuclear forensics capabilities.

Accurately identifying the material’s source, based on reliable scientific methods, is crucial to ensuring successful prosecution of smugglers, finding and addressing breaches in nuclear security globally, and supporting appropriate national responses to perpetrators of nuclear terrorism.  Nuclear forensics helps the United States to hold fully accountable any state, terrorist group, or other non-state actor that supports or enables terrorist efforts to obtain or use weapons of mass destruction.  DNDO will continue to invest in nuclear forensics technologies, such as the RMS, to help prevent, deter, and respond to nuclear smuggling and nuclear terrorism.

This post was co-authored by Dr. Kathryn Sullivan, the Undersecretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere and NOAA Administrator and Craig Fugate, Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency

Our nation experiences some of the most extreme and dangerous weather in the world, and this winter, California faces a particularly severe threat. Forecasts are showing a strong and peaking El Niño that could deliver drenching conditions to the state and throughout the South. These predicted conditions come with an enhanced flood threat through the spring.

Making matters worse, much of the landscape in California today is already dry and parched, due in part to historic drought and recent wildfires. This hard, packed soil, combined with vegetation loss and burn scars on the earth, can cause extensive runoff because rainwater and snowmelt won't effectively be absorbed into the ground. The runoff could turn into destructive flash floods and mud slides, making it vitally important that people are aware and prepared for what conditions may come in the next few months and beyond.

So, while we're beginning to see signs of relief after four long and difficult years of extreme drought, we must be prepared to respond to the hazards that increased snow and rain can present to our homes, neighborhoods, and communities. In the short term, more accurate weather forecasts, coupled with actions taken by cities and households to prepare for severe weather, could save lives, property, and build more resilient communities. In fact, research shows that those who are informed and ready when hazardous or extreme weather threatens rebound more quickly and recover more fully from disasters.

If there was ever a year for families in California to take action to prepare for severe weather and flooding, this is the year. One way to do so is by purchasing flood insurance. Flooding remains the most common and costly disaster we see in America, even in non-El Niño years. Being insured can protect homeowners financially from this common hazard. Flood insurance is not typically included in standard homeowner policies. You cannot get flood insurance at the last minute. It usually takes about 30 days to take effect, so the time to take action is now. FEMA's FloodSmart.gov contains information about your community's specific threat from flooding and connects you to insurance agents that can help you get covered.

There's more that California residents should do now to prepare themselves for the impact of severe weather. Now is the time to put together a family communication plan. Disasters don't always occur when families are together in one place. Talk with your family about ways to contact each other during an emergency and designate a safe meeting spot. Plan ahead by knowing official evacuation routes, and keeping important papers in a safe, waterproof place. Additional tips and resources on how to stay safe and prepare are available at ready.gov.

Science tells us that climate extremes may become the 'new normal' for the West Coast. As such, we can expect more drought, wildfires and other natural disasters to occur while we build, grow, and prepare our communities to be more resilient to change. We must strive to keep people, property, and critical infrastructure out of harm's way, protect the capacity of floodplains to absorb floodwaters when pounding rain pours down, and empower Americans to thoughtfully prepare for hazards early and conserve water and other vital natural resources wherever possible.

As the United States works to become a Weather-Ready Nation -- one that is resilient to extreme weather -- it's helpful for people to review how family and community resiliency grows from a combination of accurate forecasts, and individual knowledge and preparedness. Building resilient families, communities, and businesses is at the heart of our work at NOAA and FEMA. We ask Californians to get ready for winter, and remain prepared throughout the season for floods, continued drought and wildfire risks, and any other extreme weather it might bring.",tsa

The U and T Visa Law Enforcement Resource Guide provides federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial law enforcement officials with helpful information to support the investigations and prosecution of crimes involving qualified immigrant victims.

The Department is committed to supporting law enforcement investigations and the prosecution of crimes of human trafficking, domestic violence and other serious harm, as well as civil and criminal investigations into labor exploitation and abuse.

Lack of legal immigration status in the United States may be among the reasons that some victims choose not to come forward or work with law enforcement.  Perpetrators and human traffickers also use victims’ lack of legal status as leverage to exploit and control them. Congress created the U and T nonimmigrant visas to address this with the passage of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act (including the Battered Immigrant Women's Protection Act) in October 2000. Congress sought not only to create tools to help law enforcement prosecute perpetrators of crimes committed against immigrants, but also to strengthen relations between law enforcement and immigrant communities.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) helps to protect victims of these crimes by providing immigration relief through U and T visas. Law enforcement agencies, prosecutors, judges, and government officials also play an important role in this process.

The U and T Visa Law Enforcement Resource Guide  was first released in 2012, and the Department will continue to provide updates to our law enforcement partners so that together we can protect victims and put an end to these terrible crimes.

"Over the last decade, we have become a stronger, safer, and more secure nation. The Department of Homeland Security continues to make our nation and communities more resilient, not only to terrorist and violent extremist attacks, but also to threats and disasters of all kinds, while safeguarding the fundamental rights of all Americans.

At the University of Michigan – Dearborn, Secretary Jeh Johnson met with student leaders to discuss how the Department works with local communities to counter violent extremism. We asked these students: What does hometown security mean to you? Why is #DHSinDearborn important for the next generation of homeland security leaders?

""I am a junior studying political science and philosophy. I’m the president of the Political Science Association here at University of Michigan – Dearborn. As an Arab-American, and especially as a refugee from Iraq who is an American, it’s very important for me to have a discussion with the Secretary of Homeland Security, especially since there is a large Arab population in this part of Michigan. It’s very important for them to understand exactly what is going on in terms of our security, because we do value our security here. It’s important to have these discussions and be open with each other.""

“I am a senior, I’m going to law school next year, I’m the Vice President student government, and being able to have my story heard about my experiences, especially as an undergraduate, particularly in the community that University of Michigan – Dearborn has offered me, I think is really impactful and I think that it could really help things.”

“I’m a junior, and today, just to be in the presence of the Secretary of Homeland Security is eye-opening because UM-Dearborn is a small campus that is so diverse, and for us to be able to bring people like this into the campus, to help our students, better understand national security and help us get a greater grasp on what’s going on in the world around us, I think is very critical and very important. So, I’m greatly appreciative. I’m in the Army ROTC program at the University, and I’m in my third year. When I graduate, I will be commissioned as a second lieutenant, but I’m thinking about going to law school. If I do go to law school after, I get commissioned as a captain.”

“I’m in my third year at University of Michigan – Dearborn. I’m a double major in psychology and Women & Gender studies, and a minor in Sociology. I’m currently the president of the social justice league, and I’m in several other student organizations on this campus. Being with the Secretary today really goes to show the importance of having the public’s voice heard, and just the fact that we are able to be present here today with our government officials to talk about national and international security really takes into account the cultivation of the power of the people and the power of voice.”

“I’m the student government president here at University of Michigan – Dearborn and I’m a senior studying political science and criminal justice. I think the government thrives when it listens to its people and understands what the people they represent want. I think that it’s important to listen to college students, especially a college that is as diverse and wonderful as University of Michigan – Dearborn.”",tsa
"The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Enhanced Cybersecurity Services (ECS) program has approved its Commercial Service Providers (CSPs) to offer a new capability called Netflow Analysis, which will allow the CSPs to more effectively identify and analyze malicious activity transiting their customers’ networks.

Through the ECS program, DHS provides CSPs with classified or sensitive information about known cyber threats. The CSPs, in turn, use this information to protect their customers against unauthorized access, exploitation, and data exfiltration.

Privacy is fundamental to all DHS cybersecurity programs. DHS’s Privacy Office recently completed an update to the ECS Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA), and the updated PIA notes that the Netflow Analysis capability does not enable DHS to collect, store, or in any way utilize personally identifiable information, and thus does not result in significant privacy risks. None of the ECS capabilities, including Netflow Analysis, involve government monitoring of private networks or communications.

Netflow Analysis joins two other existing ECS capabilities: Domain Name Service (DNS) Sinkholing and Email Filtering. CSP customers may subscribe to any or all of the ECS capabilities, depending on their needs. U.S.-based organizations including state, local, tribal, or territorial governments interested in ECS should reach out directly to the four accredited CSPs for enrollment information:

Over the past year, the DHS ECS program has reached several exciting milestones. In June 2015, ECS expanded eligibility requirements beyond critical infrastructure to allow all U.S.-based public and private organizations to receive services, while in August 2015, ECS accredited a fourth CSP, Lockheed Martin. We are always striving to improve services and capabilities for this important program.",tsa
"Data Privacy Day is an international effort held annually on January 28 to create awareness about the importance of privacy and protecting personal information.

In today’s connected world, we’re sharing more personal information online than ever before. And it’s not only when we’re sitting at our computers: we use our mobile devices to shop, bank, conduct business, and connect with loved ones. These activities often require us to provide personal information such as our name, email address, credit card information, and other sensitive details online. But when this information falls into the wrong hands, it can be exploited and used to steal your identity and your money. As sharing personal information online becomes commonplace, it is increasingly critical to take steps to protect your personal data and privacy.

Protecting your personal information can appear to be a daunting task, but there are simple steps all Americans can take to protect themselves and their privacy online. Start with these tips from the Stop.Think.Connect. Campaign, the Department of Homeland Security’s national cybersecurity awareness campaign.

On Data Privacy Day and throughout the year, we encourage all Americans to weigh the benefits and risks of sharing information online, to understand how their information is being used, and to take steps to protect their identities and personal data.

"We are a nation of immigrants – it’s at the very core of our American values. Our success as a nation of immigrants is rooted in our historic success in integrating newcomers into the social, cultural, and economic fabric of our country. Last December, during a naturalization ceremony welcoming 31 new Americans, President Obama reminded us of this history:

We can never say it often or loudly enough: Immigrants and refugees revitalize and renew America…Immigrants are the teachers who inspire our children, and they’re the doctors who keep us healthy. They’re the engineers who design our skylines, and the artists and the entertainers who touch our hearts. Immigrants are soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, Coast Guardsmen who protect us, often risking their lives for an America that isn’t even their own yet…We celebrate this history, this heritage, as an immigrant nation.

In the spirit of these core American values, President Obama established the White House Task Force on New Americans to strengthen federal immigrant and refugee integration efforts and promote the best practices that state and local governments are using to help immigrants and their native-born neighbors succeed together. As Task Force co-chairs, we are heartened by what we have already achieved together with state and local governments as well as business, community, faith, and philanthropic leaders.

To build on these efforts, the Task Force is launching a series of White House Regional Convenings on New Americans – with the inaugural convening taking place in Los Angeles today. This will be the first in a number of events aimed at strengthening and supporting local immigrant and refugee integration efforts.

These convenings will be organized in partnership with Building Welcoming Communities Campaign cities and counties, local leaders, and federal agencies, and aim to: (1) Strengthen the federal regional infrastructure supporting welcoming and integration efforts; (2) Highlight best practices; and (3) Broaden and deepen multisector partnerships at the local level to advance civic, economic, and linguistic integration efforts.

Today’s initiative was highlighted as a key 2016 effort in the Task Force’s One-Year Progress Report, which was submitted to the President in December 2015. This report provided an update on the recommendations issued in the Task Force’s Strategic Action Plan in April 2015. It also builds on White House convenings held in Washington, DC in July 2014 and October 2015.

President Obama, along with the many Americans engaged in this effort, feels strongly that advancing the cherished American ideals of citizenship, and the pride and responsibility that comes with being a U.S. citizen, is central to our strength as a nation. These Regional Convenings will further the mission of the “Stand Stronger” Citizenship Awareness Campaign, an initiative launched last Fall that encourages eligible lawful permanent residents to learn more about the naturalization process so they can solidify their roots and tap into the incredible opportunities that await new American citizens.

The Department of Homeland Security estimates that there are approximately 13.3 million lawful permanent residents living in the United States, and 8.8 million of them are eligible to apply for citizenship. We know that becoming a naturalized citizen bring tangible and intangible benefits to each new American, to the communities in which they live, and to the rest of the country.

To address the barriers to becoming a citizen, USCIS also developed a series of initiatives to improve customer service, highlight the importance of citizenship, and support aspiring citizens. These initiatives include new online citizenship preparation resources, the ability to pay the naturalization fee with a credit card, a citizenship public education and awareness campaign, and new and ongoing outreach and engagement with local governments.

Immigrants and refugees contribute to our country’s social and cultural fabric. They are critical to our country’s continued prosperity. The Task Force will continue to do everything possible to welcome them into our nation and work with cities and counties to build welcoming communities where everyone can thrive.",tsa
"The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) today is excited to announce two new partnerships between the DHS Blue Campaign, the unified voice for the Department’s efforts to combat human trafficking, and the California Hotel & Lodging Association (CH&LA) and the San Joaquin Regional Rail Commission (SJRRC) Altamont Corridor Express (ACE).

This announcement is especially important as the Department continues its efforts to help ensure the security of visitors and fans for Super Bowl 50. High-profile events, like the Super Bowl, draw large crowds and have become lucrative opportunities for criminals engaged in human trafficking. CH&LA and SJRRC ACE will display Blue Campaign materials at lodging and railway stops throughout California, providing residents and visitors to the area with information about the indicators of human trafficking and how to report it. Materials will also have resources and information on how to receive support for potential victims.



A sample Blue Campaign message about the indicators of human trafficking

“It is our responsibility to speak up and act for those who cannot,” said SJRRC ACE Safety and Security Supervisor Steve Walker.

“As an industry, we recognize the important role that hotels can play in fighting human trafficking networks which often rely on legitimate businesses such as hotels to sustain their operations,” said CH&LA President and CEO Lynn Mohrfeld. “CH&LA is looking forward to partnering with the DHS Blue Campaign to help combat human trafficking within the hotel and lodging industry.”

Last year, ahead of Super Bowl XLIX, the Blue Campaign established partnerships with the City of Phoenix and the Arizona Human Trafficking Council of the Governor’s Office for Children, Youth, and Families to provide training and awareness materials.

The Blue Campaign will continue to work in collaboration with local law enforcement, government, non-governmental and private organizations to protect the basic right of freedom and to bring those who exploit human lives to justice.",tsa
"Photo of the Week:  A U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) helicopter patrols the airspace around Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, CA, the site of Super Bowl 50.

"Yesterday, while football fans tuned in to see the Denver Broncos and the Carolina Panthers take the field, dozens of components with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) – both seen and unseen – proudly worked to make sure that Super Bowl 50 was a safe and enjoyable experience for players, employees, and fans alike.

From the stadium and well beyond, DHS components – including TSA, CBP, ICE, Coast Guard, the Secret Service, FEMA, our Office of Intelligence and Analysis, and our National Protection and Programs Directorate –contributed to the security of more than 15 million fans and visitors.

Earlier this week, Secretary Johnson visited the San Francisco area where he met with local law enforcement officials and the National Football League (NFL) security team to oversee the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) security operations.

Securing the Super Bowl is a shared responsibility, and all of DHS worked together to do our part.

Transportation Security Administration (TSA) officers, Passenger Screening Canine teams, Behavior Detection and Analysis Officers, and other specialists secured area airports and mass transit locations.

The U.S. Secret Service supported open-source social media monitoring for situational awareness and assisted with cyber security vulnerability assessments and mitigation. The Secret Service also conducted magnetometer training for security personnel.

The U.S. Coast Guard provided maritime security and interagency support ahead of and during the Super Bowl through increased patrols, ferry security and cruise ship security operations.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) helped ensure the legitimacy of game-related merchandise by targeting counterfeit vendors and local merchants of game-related sportswear.

CBP’s Air and Marine Operations helped secure the skies surrounding Levi’s stadium, deploying three Black Hawk helicopters, three Cessna C-550 Citations and two AS350 Astar helicopters oversee the areas restricted airspace. CBP also screened cargo entering the stadium contraband such as narcotics, weapons, and explosives.

The DHS Blue Campaign is the unified voice for efforts to combat human trafficking. Throughout the bay area – including airports, transit hubs, buses, and hotels – the Campaign displayed awareness materials to help individuals and communities identify and recognize indicators of human trafficking.",tsa
"Yesterday, the White House announced the Cybersecurity National Action Plan (CNAP), an important new initiative to bolster our Nation’s cybersecurity. Cybersecurity is one of the Department of Homeland Security’s highest priorities, and we’ve recently made significant progress increasing the cybersecurity posture of our government, our citizens, and our critical infrastructure.

DHS has enhanced federal cybersecurity by expanding our EINSTEIN and Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM) programs. As directed by Congress, EINSTEIN 3 Accelerated—which strengthens perimeter defense for federal civilian agencies by detecting and blocking known cyber threats,  including classified threats—will protect all federal civilian agencies by the end of 2016. DHS is also piloting an analytic-based “reputation scoring” system as part of EINSTEIN which will prioritize indicators by likely severity and identify new potential threats. By the end of 2016, all federal civilian agencies will also have implemented CDM Phase 1, which detects vulnerabilities in computers and software and prioritizes these risks, enabling agencies to fix the most severe vulnerabilities first. DHS will also increase its federal civilian cyber defense teams from 10 to 48. These teams will respond to incidents, conduct “red team” penetration testing, proactively hunt for intruders on federal networks, and help agencies design more secure systems.

DHS is developing a cadre of cybersecurity professionals to defend our Nation’s networks. The Department has expanded access to the Federal Virtual Training Environment—an online, on-demand training system that provides access to cybersecurity curricula—to federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial government employees and U.S. veterans. DHS hosts the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Careers and Studies website, a searchable catalogue of cybersecurity training, education, and career opportunities, and offers a Cyber Student Volunteer Initiative for college students pursuing cybersecurity-related degrees in which they participate in hands-on cybersecurity work as well as mentoring and professional development activities. The Department also co-sponsors CyberCorps Scholarship for Service and the National Centers for Academic Excellence in Cybersecurity Program, both of which are intended to produce a pipeline of cybersecurity professionals.

The CNAP calls for a new public awareness campaign to encourage Americans to use multi-factor authentication for their online accounts. This campaign will build upon the success of DHS’s Stop.Think.Connect. campaign, which promotes safe online behavior and practices. Since 2010, the Campaign has increased Americans’ understanding of cyber threats and empowered them to be safer online through partnerships, audience-specific resources, and events like National Cyber Security Awareness Month.

DHS encourages critical infrastructure owners and operators to manage cyber risk by adopting the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. The Department’s Critical Infrastructure Cyber Community Voluntary Program supports the practical application of the Framework by facilitating access to free technical assistance, tools, and related resources. In support of this effort DHS will host nearly 180 events throughout 2016. DHS will also increase the number of Cybersecurity Advisors available to assist critical infrastructure entities.

Recognizing that cyber threat information sharing is essential to the protection of critical infrastructure, the Department has made significant progress improving the scale, scope, and speed of its information sharing initiatives. Among these many achievements: the Cyber Information Sharing and Collaboration Program has expanded to more than 160 private sector participants; the Enhanced Cybersecurity Services program has expanded beyond critical infrastructure entities to all U.S.-based public and private organizations, added a third service offering and a fourth Commercial Service Provider; and DHS recently selected the University of Texas at San Antonio as the Information Sharing and Analysis Organization Standards Organization, which will publish a first draft of best practices this summer. As mandated by Congress, DHS is also relaunching its Automated Indicator Sharing initiative this month, which will enable the exchange of cyber threat indicators between private sector entities and the government at machine speed, allowing participants to mitigate cyber threats on their networks in near-real-time while protecting Americans’ privacy and civil liberties.

In addition, DHS is working with Congress to further strengthen our efforts to protect critical infrastructure by transitioning the National Protection and Programs Directorate to a new operational component called Cyber and Infrastructure Protection, which includes elevating the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center to the Assistant Secretary level and more fully enlisting our field forces to greatly expand our ability to help businesses manage cyber risks.

The CNAP is an important strategy to enhance cybersecurity awareness and protections, protect privacy, maintain public safety as well as economic and national security, and empower Americans to take better control of their digital security. These are important priorities for DHS, and we will continue to further our efforts to ensure a safer and more secure cyberspace.",tsa

In this series of three blog posts celebrating Presidents Day, we honor three of our nation's presidents who grew up with immigrant parents.

The mother of the United States' 28th president, Woodrow Wilson, was an immigrant.

Janet E. ""Jessie"" Woodrow was born in Carlisle, England, in 1830. She immigrated with her family to New York in 1836, then to Canada before settling in Chillicothe, Ohio. In 1849 she married Joseph Ruggles Wilson. In 1856 she gave birth to Thomas Woodrow, the third of four children, in their new home in Staunton, Virginia. Janet passed away in 1888.

Woodrow (who would go by his middle name, which was his mother's maiden name) didn't begin reading until he was 10. Yet much of his adolescence and early adulthood revolved around education. He attended Davidson College in North Carolina before transferring to the College of New Jersey (which would later change its name to Princeton University). He attended law school at the University of Virginia for one year. He earned his doctorate while studying history and political science at Johns Hopkins University.

Woodrow Wilson held his first elected office when he became governor of New Jersey in 1911. Two years later he was in the White House, having been elected president of the United States. He led the nation from 1913 to 1921.

"Last month, the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) conducted a joint trial with Singapore’s Ministry of Home Affairs to assess the U.S.-developed Radiological Multisensor Analysis Platform system. This trial marks an important milestone in what has been a successful research and development collaboration between Singapore and the United States.  The collaboration has led to the advancement of capabilities to detect, identify, and localize radiological and nuclear threats.

The Radiological Multisensor Analysis Platform combines a street view-like capability with real-time radiation detection, identification, and localization.  The system can detect and localize radioactive materials while moving, as well as overlay radiation data with visual and laser imaging data to enable a 3-D reconstruction of the environment in conjunction with the radiation signatures.  This “Nuclear Street View” has the potential to be an invaluable tool to improve the ability for operators to detect nuclear threats.

The trial scenarios, which took place in Singapore, included both maritime and land border ports of entry, as well as urban searches, to demonstrate the technological and operational feasibility to screen moving passenger vehicles and cargo containers.  The system also demonstrated the capability to conduct directed searches for potential threats.

Preventing a nuclear or radiological attack is the mission of DNDO.  Collaborations with international partners such as this are vital to our efforts to build and enhance global capabilities to counter nuclear smuggling.  This trial highlights the important cooperation between DHS and Singapore’s Ministry of Home Affairs, and further underscores the commitment of both nations to address the threat of nuclear terrorism.

Top left is the operator-interface of the Radiological Multisensor Analysis Platform which is within the vehicle in the bottom right. DNDO and Singapore officials worked together to test the technology’s ability to detect radiation in several operational environments including the above simulated collapsed building.

In this series of three blog posts celebrating Presidents Day, we honor three of our nation’s presidents who grew up with immigrant parents.

The mother of the United States’ 31st president, Herbert Hoover, was an immigrant.

Hulda Randall Minthorn was born in Norwich, Ontario, Canada, in 1848. Her family immigrated to the United States in 1859 and settled in West Branch, Iowa. After her father died, Hulda dropped out of the University of Iowa to help her mother cope with his death. In 1870 Hulda married Jesse Hoover. They had three children; Herbert was the middle child. When Jesse died in 1880, Hulda used the money from his insurance policy to pay for the children's schooling. She also traveled throughout the state as a Quaker minister. During one trip she fell ill with pneumonia and never recovered. Hulda passed away in 1884 at the age of 35.

After college, Herbert Hoover was a mining engineer and businessman, working with gold mines in Western Australia. When World War I began, he focused on humanitarian work. He helped 120,000 stranded American tourists return home from Europe. He also coordinated delivery of food and supplies to Belgians when Germany invaded their country.

Hoover served as secretary of commerce before winning the 1928 presidential election. Just seven months after he took office, the stock market crashed in October 1929. Amid the Great Depression, he led the nation from 1929 to 1933.

"On Feb. 20, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson traveled to Laredo, Texas, where he participated in an International Bridge Ceremony, also known as the “Abrazo Ceremony,” on the Juárez-Lincoln International Bridge. The ceremony was followed by a parade and is part of a 119-year-old tradition honoring George Washington’s Birthday.

As part of the ceremony, two children from the U.S. side and two children from the Mexican side meet midway across the Lincoln-Juarez bridge and hug. A parade followed the official ceremony.

Secretary Johnson spoke about the importance of continued cooperation between the United States and Mexico to promote lawful trade and travel between our two nations.

“What is a bridge? ¿Que es un puente? It is a structure to connect two lands. It is a structure to enable people and things to cross from one land to the other. It is a structure that enables commerce, relationships and friendships. It enables the people of one land to know the other. Build bridges and we build friendships. This bridge and this ceremony are both a real and symbolic sign of the enduring friendship between the people of the United States and the people of Mexico.”

"I wholeheartedly agree with the President when he said in a recent interview with Popular Science that, “when young people are excited about science, technology, engineering, and math, that’s not just good for them. That’s good for America.”

This week is an example of fostering that excitement as the White House celebrates National Week at the Labs. DHS S&T will do its part to inspire and involve students to pursue science, technology, engineering and mathematics, or what we call STEM. An education in STEM means so much more than sitting in a laboratory, it provides the necessary skills to enter the cutting-edge technology fields. This could be anything from a FitBit® to a self-driving car.

I see on a daily basis how important STEM is to our nation as the head of the research and development arm of DHS.  We create technological capabilities for DHS components and first responders, like a 3-D printed robot to be assembled on site, allowing bomb squads to assess threats with minimal risk to others. Our world is ever-changing, and it wasn’t that long ago that a single computer could fill a room and was only operated by highly-trained scientists. Today, grade-school children use smart phones and tablets that can do the work of ten of those room-sized computers.

Just a couple weeks ago, I sat down with students at Thurgood Marshall Academy in DC to talk with them about the real-world value of STEM. We need to encourage young people to seek out STEM-related careers and ensure STEM skills are a part of their everyday development; you never know who is going to come up with the next self-driving car.

S&T supports the President’s efforts to encourage everyone, including women and minorities, to pursue careers in STEM fields, and we always look for ways to create opportunities. We launched an initiative to increase outreach to Historically Black Colleges and Universities as well as other communities of Minority Serving Institutions.  S&T’s Centers of Excellence research network includes about 50 Minority Serving Institutions and stress the importance of drawing under-represented groups into STEM related fields. Additionally, our Workforce Development Initiatives help educate and train the current and future homeland security workforce in science and engineering professions through grants, internships and fellowships, and allow students an opportunity to acquire advanced technical knowledge and training that otherwise might not be available to them through the average classroom.

In the coming months, I’ll continue to speak to middle and high school students to empower and inspire today’s youth to seek out STEM careers, and fuel their curiosity through storytelling and live demonstrations.

The STEM students I meet are passionate and energized about pursuing all that is possible as we continue to make amazing technological strides. Their attitudes and vision will continue make our planet a better place for everyone, and I will do my part to ensure that every student feels that possibility to be on the frontlines of technology for his or herself. Right now, there is a student somewhere who will go on to be a leader in the sciences, perhaps even lead S&T here at DHS.

"We’ve added a fourth Commercial Service Provider, Lockheed Martin, to provide cybersecurity service to customers. Commercial Service Providers receive cyber threat indicators through the Department of Homeland Security Enhanced Cybersecurity Services (ECS) program, which they in turn use to help protect and secure the networks of their customers. ECS is a voluntary information sharing program that assists U.S.-based public and private entities as they improve the protection of their systems from unauthorized access, exploitation, or data exfiltration.

This new announcement is a continuation of our efforts to expand cybersecurity information sharing services to all U.S.-based public and private organizations through ECS.

All accredited Commercial Service Providers must achieve a high standard of security competence, including retaining the ability to safeguard sensitive information, obtaining personnel and facilities clearances, and constructing secure network systems. Lockheed Martin joins three additional companies—AT&T, CenturyLink, and Verizon—who have met the stringent standards for ECS accreditation.

ECS has proven to be a highly effective part of a layered defense, and we encourage its use for organizations seeking to implement additional protections against sophisticated threats. ECS embeds privacy protections in its operations, ensuring industry can benefit from cyber threat indicator sharing without relinquishing privacy and civil liberties protections.

U.S.-based companies interested in ECS service may reach out directly to the four accredited Commercial Service Providers for more information:

ECS is part of a larger DHS effort to broaden information sharing activities. The effort includes programs like the Cyber Information Sharing and Collaboration Program and capability developments such as Automated Information Sharing and Information Sharing and Analysis Organization models.",tsa
"As part of our efforts to share timely and actionable cyber threat information with the private sector, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has expanded the Enhanced Cybersecurity Services (ECS) program beyond those entities classified as “critical infrastructure” to all interested U.S.-based public and private organizations. ECS solves a difficult challenge for the U.S. government:  sometimes, the government has information so sensitive that the information is classified. If information is classified, we cannot share it broadly with the private sector to let companies protect themselves.

The solution is ECS. Through ECS, DHS shares sensitive and classified cyber threat indicators from across government with Commercial Service Providers (CSPs). In turn, these CSPs, use this information to protect their customers from cyber threats. CSPs are thus a managed security service: a company can pay to receive the security service that these CSPs offer.

ECS provides an invaluable layer of defense to augment an organization’s existing capabilities for protecting against unauthorized access and data exfiltration.

Until recently, this program was only available to those companies that DHS certified as “critical infrastructure.” With this expansion, CSPs are able to offer ECS services available to all interested U.S.-based public and private organizations.

Since its launch in 2013, ECS has detected more than 800,000 indicators of malicious cyber activity. It has proven to be a highly effective part of a layered defense, and I recommend it for any organization seeking to implement additional protections against sophisticated threats.

"The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) works closely with the Department of Energy (DOE) and the electric sector to ensure the security, resilience, and reliability of the U.S. power grid. Additionally, many American utility providers have invested heavily in both cyber and physical security. While the U.S. power grid is highly resilient, it’s important for owners and operators of electric and other critical infrastructure sector assets to be aware of this particular threat and to implement mitigation steps that will reduce their vulnerabilities to similar cyber-attacks and other malicious activity employing these tactics, techniques, and procedures. To be clear, this threat applies to any sector that uses industrial control systems, not just the electric sector.

Last December, several Ukrainian power companies experienced an apparent cyber-attack that resulted in unscheduled power outages lasting up to six hours that impacted over 200,000 customers. At the request of the Ukrainian government, an U.S. interagency team comprised of representatives from DHS’s Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team (ICS-CERT) and United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) as well as the DOE, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, traveled to Ukraine to gather information about the incident and identify potential mitigations.

At this time, there is no evidence of similar malicious activity affecting U.S. critical infrastructure. However, U.S. critical infrastructure entities have been affected by targeted intrusions in recent years, and it is imperative that critical infrastructure owners and operators across all sectors are aware and up-to-date on the cyber threat landscape and the measures they can take to protect their assets.

As part of our ongoing mission to share information, DHS has posted a public alert on the ICS-CERT website, in addition to a technical alert to a secure portal for critical infrastructure partners. The Department has also provided briefings to critical infrastructure partners and international allies. DHS has already provided a briefing to the electric sector, and we have upcoming briefings with the chemical, nuclear, transportation, natural gas, and water sectors via Sector Coordinating Councils and Information Sharing and Analysis Centers.

Critical infrastructure owners and operators need to be aware of  malicious cyber activity and take measures to protect their assets. They should read the ICS-CERT Incident Alert regarding this incident and implement mitigation practices outlined in the alert. Those recommended mitigation actions will reduce their exposure to many types of cyber threats. More detailed technical information is available on the secure ICS-CERT portal. To join this portal, critical infrastructure owners and operators should email ics-cert@hq.dhs.gov. For more general recommendations, critical infrastructure owners and operators should review the “Seven Steps to Effectively Defend Industrial Control Systems.”

Our work does not stop here. DHS is planning an expanded outreach campaign to all critical infrastructure sector asset owners and operators to discuss the Ukraine incident and provide detection and mitigation strategies to prevent cyber-attacks using these malicious techniques and tactics. Information sharing is a key part of our cybersecurity mission and we will continue to do so in the interest of public safety.",tsa
"From Feb. 29 to March 3, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson was in Turkey to further our cooperation and collaboration with his counterparts. Working with governments around the world, like the government of Turkey, allows us to keep our homeland safer and more secure.

For the trip, Secretary Johnson was joined by U.S. Ambassador to Turkey John Bass as well as senior leadership from across the Department.

Secretary Johnson’s first stop in Turkey was Adana, located approximately 90 miles from the border with Syria. In Adana, the Secretary visited the Saricam Refugee Camp, a Turkish-government run Syrian refugee camp that houses more than 10,000 refugees. While at the Saricam camp, Secretary Johnson spoke to a number of Syrian and Iraqi refugee children and families.

In Istanbul, Secretary Johnson met with the Governor of Istanbul Vasip Sahin, to discuss ways to deepen our bilateral collaboration.

While in Istanbul, Secretary Johnson and the official delegation had the opportunity to partake in the longstanding Turkish culture and tradition, taking moments throughout the trip to admire the rich history and national treasures.

On Thursday, Secretary Johnson traveled to Ankara. He had the privilege of participating in a ceremonial wreath laying at the tomb of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the founder and first President of Turkey.

The Secretary met with Turkish Customs and Trade Minister Bülent Tüfenkci to sign a Letter of Intent aimed at advancing border security and promoting information sharing in the pursuit of enhanced customs enforcement.

In addition to Minister Tüfenkci, Secretary Johnson also met with the Turkish Minister of Interior Efkan Ala with whom he signed a Letter of Intent to advance security cooperation between U.S. and Turkish law enforcement agencies.

DHS seeks to deepen its partnerships with Turkey to enhance aviation and border security, combat terrorism, and bolster customs enforcement through international collaboration and the sharing of best practices.

Cyber threats to critical infrastructure remain one of our Nation’s most serious security and economic sustainability challenges. With over 80 percent of critical infrastructure owned by the private sector, and with millions of cyber-dependent equities owned by individuals or federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) entities and agencies, securing cyberspace must be achieved collaboratively. Exercises are critical to testing this coordination, and more importantly, to building and maintaining strong relationships among the cyber incident response community.

Last week more than 1,100 people from more than 60 organizations across the country and worldwide participated in the nation’s most extensive cybersecurity exercise, hosted by the Department of Homeland Security, Cyber Storm V. The exercise included participants from the healthcare and public health, IT, communications and commercial facilities sectors, as well as federal agencies, eight states, and international organizations.

Participants were presented with a scenario that drove them to exercise their training, policies, processes, and procedures for identifying and responding to a multi-sector cyber attack targeting critical infrastructure. The Cyber Storm V scenario created an environment where no one organization was in a position where they themselves could stop or mitigate the impacts of the attack. The scope of the scenario thus promoted the exercising of cooperation and information sharing across the United States government, states, the private sector, and international partners.

The DHS National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) served as the focal point for federal response and coordination during the exercise.  NCCIC is a 24x7 cyber situational awareness, incident response, and management center that is a national nexus of cyber and communications integration for the Federal Government, intelligence community, and law enforcement. NCCIC also is designated as the federal interface for private sector information sharing, cross-sector coordination and incident response.

The Cyber Storm V after action process began with a discussion of initial, high-level findings. An after action conference will help validate these findings and inform the development of an after action report.

"Secretary Johnson today hosted U.S. Reps. Michael McCaul and John Ratcliffe at DHS’ National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) to officially deploy a system to exchange cyber threat indicators between government and the private sector at machine speed.

The system, known as Automated Indicator Sharing (AIS), will mitigate cyber threats in near-real-time, ultimately reducing the prevalence of cybersecurity compromises.  Secretary Johnson presented the congressmen with an official notice certifying the deployment of AIS, meeting the deadline of today set by the Cybersecurity Act of 2015. DHS has also met prior deadlines to establish policies and procedures on privacy and how to share information.

Secretary Johnson said that, DHS is “open for business” to receive cyber threat indicators from the public and private sectors at machine speed.  This automated, real-time information sharing system is the centerpiece of our efforts at the NCCIC, he added.

AIS uses a standard that is still evolving, to adhere to the timelines established in the legislation.  Participants will eventually include federal departments and agencies, private companies, non-profit organizations, academia, foreign allies, and Information Sharing and Analysis Organizations.

This system will serve as the ""See Something, Say Something"" of the Internet. When one participant detects a threat, all participants in AIS will learn about it.  By broadening the depth and increasing the speed of cybersecurity information sharing, the country as a whole will be better able to manage cyber threats.  The Cybersecurity Act of 2015 also provides targeted liability protection to companies that share cyber threat indicators with DHS or with each other.  And like all of the department’s cybersecurity programs, AIS includes rigorous privacy and civil liberties protections.

Secretary Johnson thanked Congressmen McCaul, Ratcliffe and Thompson for their support of DHS’ cybersecurity efforts and applauded NCCIC employees for their dedication and hard work to help keep the nation safe and secure from cyber threats.",tsa

Today the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), along with eight other federal agencies, published a final rule that will provide new religious liberty protections for beneficiaries of federally funded social service programs, while also adding new protections for the ability of religious providers to compete for government funds on the same basis as any other private organization.  The Department is proud to now have a final rule in place that provides clear guidance to the organizations that participate in our social service programs, and protects beneficiaries of these vital programs:

For instance, if a faith-based organization receives funding from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and provides disaster case management to a beneficiary, beneficiaries must be notified in writing that they: cannot be discriminated against based on religion; cannot be required to attend or participate in any privately funded religious activities that are offered separate from this federally funded program; and may request an alternative provider if the beneficiary objects to the religious character of the organization.  At the same time, the regulations require that all decisions about DHS’s financial assistance be based solely on merit, without regard to an organization’s religious affiliation or lack thereof.  The regulations—which are being published after public notice and comment—formally implement Executive Order 13559, Principles and Policymaking Criteria for Partnerships with Faith-Based and Other Neighborhood Organizations (which amends Executive Order 13279).

 

“These regulations build on widespread agreement that we can and should do more to protect the religious liberty of beneficiaries and provide greater clarity and transparency about applicable church-state rules,” said Melissa Rogers, Executive Director of the White House Office of Faith-based and Neighborhood Partnerships.  “These reforms will strengthen partnerships that serve people in need, and we commend the agencies for working together to issue these final regulations.”  

 

The final regulations:

Specifically, an organization that receives direct DHS financial assistance is required (unless the service provided or an exigent circumstance makes it impracticable) to give notice to beneficiaries that—

"At DHS, we’ve recently observed an increase in ransomware attacks across the country. Ransomware is a type of malicious software, or malware, designed to block access to a computer system until a ransom is paid. Ransomware is typically spread through phishing emails or by unknowingly visiting an infected website.

Criminals may try to persuade you to inadvertently download ransomware, which would then infect your computer. For example, if you’re visiting a website, you may see a message like, “Your computer has been infected with a virus. Click here to resolve the issue.” In these cases, the computer has not yet been infected with ransomware, but clicking the link downloads the ransomware onto your computer.

After you download ransomware, a pop-up message will appear on your computer screen alerting you that your computer has been locked and that your files have been encrypted. Ransomware messages typically say something like, “Your computer was used to visit websites with illegal content. To unlock your computer, you must pay a $100 fine.” Or, “All files on your computer have been encrypted. You must pay $500 within 72 hours to regain access to your data.”

Ransomware can be devastating to an individual or an organization. Anyone with important data stored on their computer or network is at risk, including government or law enforcement agencies, healthcare systems or other critical infrastructure entities. Recovery can be a difficult process that may require the services of a reputable data recovery specialist, and some victims pay to recover their files. There is no guarantee that your files will be recovered if you pay the ransom.

The U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) released an alert last week with precautions organizations can take to protect against the threat of ransomware. These include:

More precautions and technical information is available in the alert from US-CERT.

If you believe your data has been encrypted with ransomware, report it to DHS at www.us-cert.gov/report, or contact your local FBI Field Office or Secret Service Field Office.",tsa

"The Domestic Nuclear Detection Office’s (DNDO) efforts in nuclear forensics and detection were highlighted at the fourth Nuclear Security Summit in Washington, D.C. from March 31 to April 1, 2016.  The Nuclear Security Summit has focused international efforts to address nuclear terrorism since it was launched by President Obama in 2010.

In support of the 2016 Summit, DNDO led the development of two nuclear forensics contributions, commonly known as “house gifts,” which are a nation’s accomplishments since the previous Summit.  These house gifts provide a means for further collaboration with international partners.

The first house gift was a fact sheet on certified reference materials, which are used to verify the accuracy of nuclear forensics conclusions.  DNDO is working with the interagency to develop these materials and make them available to the international community.  Nuclear forensics helps a nation to determine the origin of interdicted nuclear and radiological material and hold responsible parties accountable.

The second was a model that can be used for communicating with the public in a timely and effective manner during a nuclear security incident as well as in the day-to-day environment.

Additionally, we worked with other countries on a pair of nuclear security commitments made jointly by multiple international partners. The first commitment is to combat illicit trafficking and malevolent use of nuclear and other radioactive material by developing a framework, or architecture, for detecting, analyzing, and reporting on material that is outside of regulatory control. This is the first time ministers and heads of state formally endorsed efforts to develop and implement national-level nuclear security detection architectures.

The second commitment is to present the Illicit Trafficking Radiation Program report to the international community. This program was a joint U.S.-European Union effort to evaluate nuclear detection technologies against common performance goals. This report will allow international partners to better understand the performance of commercially available detectors, harmonize standards, and encourage industry to advance technology.

DNDO will continue to support international efforts to prevent nuclear terrorism after this Nuclear Security Summit through participation in international fora such as the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism and the International Atomic Energy Agency, as well as through bilateral engagements with partner nations.  These efforts help protect the Homeland against the threat of nuclear terrorism.",tsa

Kids Day started in the gym, where we met Deputy Secretary Mayorkas.  He asked all of the kids there if they knew how to say “good morning” in different languages – we heard Spanish, Chinese, German, and even learned how to say it in sign language!  Some of the kids got to introduce their parents to everyone and say what they did.  There were parents who are in the Coast Guard and parents who protect us when we fly – lots of important jobs that keep our country safe.

I didn’t even mind that it was raining because we got to do so many cool things!  Some of my favorites were saying the Pledge of Allegiance while we pretended to become citizens, looking at the President’s limousine (which has REALLY big tires), and climbing inside a big white FEMA truck that had televisions and radios all over the inside that they use when a disaster happens, like a tornado or a hurricane.  But my favorite thing was meeting a police dog named K9 Coal.  He and Officer Tyree showed us how Coal could sniff boxes and tell if there were explosives inside just by smelling.  Then I was able to take Coal’s leash, and Officer Tyree showed me how to lead him around and what to do when Coal sat down to tell me that he found something.  It was awesome!

I had a really fun time at Kids Day.  I got to meet lots of other kids, like my new friends Claire and Ansley, whose parents work at DHS with my daddy.  I also learned a lot about all of the different things that DHS does to keep all of us safe.  I can’t wait to do it again next year!",tsa

One of the most powerful images I can show people is the front page of the Washington Post in December of 2014.  A photo of two parents, both with downcast eyes and the quote, ""We were just frozen,"" when they learned their three teenagers had run away from home to join Islamic State militants in Syria. This is part of a growing number of Americans who are attempting to travel to Syria or Iraq to join the Islamic State.  And we anticipate more as recruiters from the Islamic State target youth on social media.

This was part of the discussion yesterday, when Lisa Monaco, President Obama's Homeland Security and Counterterrorism advisor visited our new offices for the Department of Homeland Security's Office for Community Partnerships and the interagency CVE Task Force. Monaco, who was joined by Deputy Homeland Security Advisor Amy Pope, met with the Task Force to go over what we are doing to face this threat at home.

Lisa Monaco, President Obama’s Homeland Security and Counterterrorism advisor, meets with the interagency CVE Task Force.

President Obama and Secretary Johnson have made countering violent extremism a key focus of our work to secure the homeland. In the current threat environment, we have to build bridges to communities and support them; they are our best defense against efforts by violent extremists to recruit and radicalize.

At the Office for Community Partnerships, we are taking our support for communities to the next level. In the coming weeks, DHS will issue a notice of funding opportunity. Non-governmental organizations will be able to apply for grants to support and develop community-based programs to prevent and intervene in the process of radicalization. This appropriation by Congress, $10 million, is a modest start, but these grants will be an important step forward. We have opened the door to providing communities with new resources to lead at the local level.

We were honored to have President Obama's top homeland security advisors with us yesterday. It shows the dedication and focus the Administration has given to this critical mission. I know that promoting trust and building relationships with communities takes time and patience. But by continuing to seek understanding and promote respect for our individual rights, we can empower communities across this country to confront the existing threat. That is what it takes to protect the homeland.

"Recently, the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) helped plan and conduct an exercise of the United States’ capability to collect radioactive evidence in the immediate aftermath of a nuclear detonation. The exercise scenario included the detonation of an Improvised Nuclear Device in an urban setting. In a real event, the evidence collected helps identify the source of the device and those responsible for its use.

The exercise, Prominent Hunt 16-1, took place near Philadelphia and involved extensive collaboration among federal and local partners, including the Philadelphia Police Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Philadelphia Field Office.

Members of the U.S. Government National Technical Nuclear Forensics Ground Collection Task Force deployed to the site of the mock detonation and collected samples of the simulated nuclear debris for analysis at designated National Laboratories.  The Task Force is an interagency group made up of specialists from the Department of Defense’s 20th Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, Explosives Command; the Air Force Technical Applications Center; the Department of Energy; and the FBI.

Unlike previous Prominent Hunt exercises, the task force – for the first time – utilized a robot to collect the radioactive evidence.  This new nuclear forensic technology, developed by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, enables the unmanned collection of samples from areas too dangerous for Task Force members to operate in safely.

Another important element of the exercise was the Army 244th Aviation Brigade and the Department of Energy utilizing airborne systems that allow them to monitor the radiation levels of the environment.  In a real event, these systems would provide information to help keep the Task Force safe and ensure the best samples for analysis are collected.

Exercises like Prominent Hunt help ensure the nation’s nuclear forensics capabilities are prepared to respond to nuclear threats.  Nuclear forensics helps the U.S. government determine who is responsible for a nuclear attack and hold those parties accountable.

"Taking leave this summer?  Even when traveling for personal time, members of the military and DoD civilians qualify for TSA Pre✓® –without any extra effort.

Lately, longer than usual lines at the airport have been in the news as the nation prepares for the busiest summer travel season on record.  To reduce the amount of time waiting in lines, while making sure passengers are safe, TSA is encouraging eligible travelers to sign up for TSA Pre✓®.  All members of the U.S. Armed Forces, including cadets and midshipmen at the U.S. service academies, and those serving in the Reserves and National Guard, can receive TSA Pre✓® benefits just by using their Department of Defense identification number.

For military members, your DOD identification number works as your known traveler number, or KTN, for all of your travel, both personal and official.  Enter the 10 digit number, located on the back of your common access card (CAC), into the KTN field when you make flight reservations to receive TSA Pre✓® benefits. You should update your Defense Travel System profile with KTN as well for official travel.  If the number is not on your CAC, you can get the number on milConnect.

DOD civilians are also eligible to receive TSA Pre✓® benefits. They can opt-in through their profile page on the milConnect site. Once they opt-in, DoD civilians will receive a KTN that they can then input in their travel bookings to receive TSA Pre✓® benefits.

When you make a reservation and include your KTN, a TSA Pre✓® indicator will appear on your boarding pass, letting you know that you can go to the TSA Pre✓® screening line. You cannot go straight to the TSA Pre✓® line with your CAC; you must enter the number when you book your travel.

Additionally, you do not have to be in uniform to go through TSA Pre✓® using your DOD identification number.

That means you can leave your shoes, belt, and light jacket on through the screening process, and leave your laptop and liquids in your bag.  It helps you get through the line more efficiently, so your screening process is more predictable and less stressful.

Secretary Johnson administered the Oath of Allegiance, and was the first to welcome the group as our fellow Americans.

“But there’s something else very special about this ceremony. Since you’ve been in this country, I suspect a lot of you, when people approach you and they look at you, or they listen to your accent, they look at the color of your skin, they look how you’re dressed, they look at the texture of your hair. They say, ‘Where are you from?’

“From this moment forward, when someone asks you that question, you can say, ‘I’m an American just like you.’ From this moment forward, when someone calls a roll call of where you are from, you are entitled to stand up when they say United States of America. I hope all of you appreciate that.” – Secretary Jeh Johnson

Congratulations to these outstanding new Americans!",tsa

"Yesterday I was joined by Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner to announce the launch of the Securing the Cities Program in Houston.  This program assists metropolitan areas in building and establishing sustainable programs to detect, interdict, and report on nuclear and other radioactive materials that are out of regulatory control.

Over the course of the 5-year program, DNDO will provide funding and support for the planning, equipment, training, and exercise assistance to partners in the Houston area.  Securing the Cities allows for the purchase of state-of-the-art commercial equipment and technology, including radiation devices, radioisotope identification devices, backpack detectors, and mobile systems.  The equipment provides a robust radiation detection capability, augmenting efforts already underway and increasing cooperation and coordination across federal, state, and local agencies.

In 2006, the Securing the Cities program was initiated in the New York City, Jersey City, and Newark region as a pilot and later expanded to the Los Angeles/Long Beach and the Washington DC areas.  Houston is the fourth city to implement the program and DNDO intends to expand the program to the Chicago area later in 2016.

The Securing the Cities program is possible because of the hard work and support of our federal, state, and local partners.  In addition to Mayor Sylvester Turner, we were honored to be joined at the launch event by Representative Sheila Jackson Lee, Representative Al Green, staff from other Representatives’ offices, and partners from the Texas Department of Public Safety, Houston Police Department, Houston Fire Department, Houston Office of Emergency Management, Pasadena Police Department, Harris County Sheriff’s Office, Harris County Office of Emergency Management, Fort Bend County Sheriff’s Office, Montgomery County Sheriff’s Office, Brazoria County Sheriff’s Office, Galveston County Sheriff’s Office, and Galveston County Office of Emergency Management.

Collaboration between DNDO and local agencies in the Houston area will help to further secure the region.  We look forward to working together to enhance the regional capabilities and continuing these valuable partnerships with Houston.",tsa
"Today, I am happy to announce the newly optimized DHS.gov website. Over the past year, DHS has worked behind the scenes to update and modernize our flagship website, making it faster and easier to use. Some of the specific differences you’ll see are:

In 2015, more than 22% of visitors to DHS.gov used either a cell phone or tablet, but the site was only configured to display on desktop computers. DHS.gov now works for desktop computers, tablets and smartphones, making it easier to get the information you need – wherever you are – in the format appropriate for your device.

Throughout the course of this effort, we updated more than 9,000 pages to simplify how information is presented to the user. Each page now features easy-to-read type and a clear introduction, so you can quickly determine if you are on the right page. We also built in collapsing sections so that longer pages of content can be quickly skimmed for relevant information.

The new DHS.gov is also fully accessible, reinforcing the Department’s commitment to meet or exceed federal Section 508 compliance standards.

Finally, we introduced new tools like updated slideshows and image carousels, which highlight new information and announcements from the Department.

Finding information on DHS.gov has never been easier.

We updated the site’s technology to make sure pages were cataloged correctly by both our search engine and external search engines, so your searches on DHS.gov will yield more accurate results. We also organized each page and section by DHS mission area, so you can see how each program or activity ties into broader Department goals.  For instance, you can use our optimized search engine to find the DHS Trusted Traveler program that works best for you.

Updating a website the size of DHS.gov is no small feat.

However, by staying focused on the needs of our customer (you), we hope this new site serves you in a more efficient way. We look forward to more updates in the future as we continue to find new and innovative ways to improve your experience with DHS.gov.",tsa

"Last night, Secretary Johnson and I attended an iftar dinner in celebration of the fast of Ramadan. Ramadan is the most sacred month of the year for Muslims, and those who observe Ramadan fast from sunrise to sunset, breaking their fast with the iftar—which literally means “breakfast.” I was honored to take part in this tradition with them.

For Muslims around the world, Ramadan is a time for restraint, for reflection, and for remembrance of those who are less fortunate. It’s a time when many Muslims rededicate themselves to charity and compassion, giving food to the hungry, while they go hungry themselves. They go without food and water by choice to better empathize with those who are without food by circumstance.

It’s also a time of community. No matter who they are, the world’s 1.6 billion Muslims spend this month together in prayer, in sacrifice, and in celebration. Friends and family come together with neighbors and strangers for the iftar meal.

Within this country alone there are about three million Muslims.  They include African Americans, Egyptian Americans, Indonesian Americans, Iraqi Americans, Syrian Americans, Iranian Americans, and many others of different races and skin colors.

But most of all, they are Americans.

American Muslims are not just members of our communities or our fellow citizens. They serve in our nation’s military and in State and Local Law enforcement across the country, in addition they are some of our most distinguished authors, doctors, lawyers, scientists, entrepreneurs, and athletes. One of our greatest athletes, Muhammad Ali, was laid to rest recently. Americans of all backgrounds came together to celebrate the life of an American Muslim champion. Thousands of people from all over the world attended an interfaith service in Louisville, Kentucky, including a former President and two heads of state.

“I am America,” Ali once said. “I am the part you won’t recognize.” Today, thanks to American Muslims like him, millions of people around the world recognize him as America. They recognize his faith as part of America.

The holy month of Ramadan is a time when Muslims across the country will invite their friends, co-workers, neighbors, and religious leaders to celebrate with them.  Many Muslim-Americans will open their homes and share their tables with friends and neighbors.

Ramadan is a time when the bonds of community grow stronger. Not just between those who share the same faith, but between all of us who share the same values.

As Director of the Office of Community Partnerships at DHS, I look forward to continuing to partner with the American Muslim community on issues affecting our homeland. Ramadan Kareem.",tsa

During her career, Bretagne responded to nearly a dozen other disasters, including Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Ivan.  Thank you Bretagne, and to all the other working dogs, for all that you did to help us.",tsa
"Several months ago while I was in Turkey I met a 9-year-old refugee named Jaafar.  I was immediately impressed with this extraordinary little boy who spoke almost perfect English.

Jaafar told me how much he and his family wanted to come to the United States for a better life.  I told Jaafar “I hope you make it to the United States.”

Ten days ago I was pleased to welcome Jaafar, his mother and two sisters to our great country.

Throughout our history, refugees have added to the fabric and strength of our Nation -- people like our former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, or Albert Einstein and Eli Weisel, two Jews displaced by Nazi Germany, or athletes like Nadia Comăneci and Luol Deng, who fled Communism and the Sudanese Civil War.

Perhaps Jaafar will grow up to be a brilliant scientist or public servant.  What we do know is that, for Jafaar and his family, the future is brighter now that they live in our great country of freedom and opportunity.

Taking in refugees at times of crisis is the right thing to do. We can and we will continue to ensure our own safety, while doing our share to welcome men, women and children who are fleeing terrorism and violence.

This is the United States of America. We can, we must, and we will do both.

"The recent shooting in Orlando reminds all Americans that the threat of violence exists in our communities. The ideology or motivation behind each attack may vary, but in common we have seen an evolution toward more independent, unaffiliated attacks inspired by extremist groups. Extremist individuals can find inspiration and encouragement through social media with geographically dispersed but like-minded extremists.

These tragedies often leave people, and particularly business owners or those organizing public events, wondering what they can do. The Department of Homeland Security’s Hometown Security initiative was created to share tools and resources for small and medium size businesses as well as people who organize public gatherings that extremists may consider appealing and easily accessible targets. Through this initiative, we encourage community partners to Connect. Plan. Train. Report.

DHS’ Protective Security Advisor program consists of approximately 100 advisors around the country that support security planning in coordination with government and private sector partners.  They also conduct vulnerability assessments, coordinate training, and support event security operations. I encourage businesses and organizations to reach out to the PSA in your community.

"Today, Secretary Johnson announced the new Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) Grant Program to support community-led initiatives across the country to build resilience to the threat of violent extremism.

This is the first federal assistance program devoted exclusively to providing local communities with the resources to counter violent extremism in the homeland. In addition to state, local and tribal governments, non-profit organizations and institutions of higher education are eligible to apply.

Violent extremism is not a threat we can ignore, particularly in light of events from Orlando to San Bernardino to Charleston. Terrorists are promoting hateful ideologies to encourage travel overseas and attract young people to violence, and the Internet makes it easier for them to do so.

Our new grant program will enable more communities prevent and deter violent extremism in these core areas:

Countering violent extremism is part of our work to protect the homeland, and building bridges to local communities is central to this mission. As the Director for the Office for Community Partnerships here at DHS, my team and I work with communities around the country every day to find innovative ways to counter this evolving threat. Some of these approaches include educational outreach, community engagement, social service programs, and training and exercises.

These grants will provide community groups—religious groups, mental health and social service providers, educators and other NGOs—with the resources to build prevention programs that address the root causes of violent extremism and deter individuals who may already be radicalizing to violence.

Today, we are taking an important step forward to support community partners in their critical efforts to prevent individuals from becoming radicalized to violence. More information about the grant opportunity and application process can be found here.",tsa

"In the 21st century, technology is ingrained into the fabric and function of our society. But the larger the role technology plays in our lives, the more opportunities unscrupulous individuals, criminal organizations and those acting in bad faith have to commit cyber-related crimes.

Given this threat, our law enforcement professionals are faced with the challenge of investigating crimes in a space where technology is constantly changing. Consequently, the knowledge of how to best combat cybercrime can become quickly perishable.

Director Connie Patrick addresses the audience during the Inaugural Cybercrime Conference. Official FLETC photo

The Department of Homeland Security is committed to making the fight against cybercrime a priority. The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center hosted its Inaugural Cybercrime Conference last week. The conference brought together more than 150 cybercrime subject matter experts from academia, private industry, and the federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement communities to exchange ideas and best practices at FLETC’s headquarters in Glynco, Georgia.

Through more than 50 training sessions covering a wide variety of topics, from electronic surveillance to geolocating, FLETC personnel sharpened their knowledge of cutting edge technologies with the help of these experts. Now, we’ll take this information to bolster our curriculum and training methods, ensuring that we can provide law enforcement with the right tools and information to fight crime on the sophisticated, rapidly evolving front lines of cyber security.

The FLETC is committed to providing our students with the best and most current training possible. Our team of professionals accomplishes this mission by engaging in research, collaboration and networking with leaders who have expertise in a wide spectrum of investigative and technological fields.

The Cybercrime Conference is the latest example of how the FLETC strives to set the gold standard in law enforcement training to best equip the thousands of men and women who do the difficult work of protecting our homeland from threats in their communities and in cyberspace each and every day.",tsa

"Today, the Department of Homeland Security’s Blue Campaign and the Department of Transportation (DOT) hosted a transportation industry stakeholder event. The event brought together leadership from both departments, as well as representatives from airline, rail, bus, and trucking companies to talk about how the transportation industry can support the fight to end human trafficking.

Human trafficking takes many forms—forced labor, domestic servitude, and sex trafficking—but all of it is an insidious crime that can victimize anyone, anywhere. Traffickers use our country’s transportation systems to move their victims from place to place as part of their horrific criminal activities. That’s why DOT and the transportation industry are such valuable partners in the Blue Campaign’s work to end human trafficking.

To combat this heinous crime in our nation’s transportation systems, we rely on the eyes and ears on the front lines—in our airplanes, at our rest stops, and on our highways. The Blue Lightning Initiative, a joint effort between DHS and DOT, is one example of our collaboration with the transportation sector. Through the Blue Lightning Initiative, DHS and DOT train airline partners to identify potential traffickers and their victims, and report their suspicions to federal law enforcement.  The Blue Campaign also continues to work with Amtrak: Since 2012, the Blue Campaign has partnered and trained thousands of its police officers to recognize the signs of human trafficking. Amtrak continues to share the Blue Campaign’s awareness materials at train stations around the country.

By continuing to raise public awareness of human trafficking and by encouraging more of the transportation industry to join the fight, today’s event was an important step forward in our continued efforts to combat this crime.

You can help combat human trafficking, too. When you’re traveling this summer, be on the lookout for indicators of human trafficking and learn how to report suspected cases. For more information, visit the Blue Campaign’s website at https://www.dhs.gov/bluecampaign.",tsa

"I’ve been working as an explosives detection canine handler at the Chicago O’Hare International Airport (ORD) since 2010. My canine partner is Doc. He’s a male black Labrador and is 5 years old. He’s also a former Marine!

It’s a blast getting to work with him every day. There isn’t a day that goes by when he isn’t excited to come to work. I have to say that his excitement is contagious. It gets me even more excited when I see his energy. So as you would imagine, we work really well together.

Canines like Doc bring an exceptional capability to the screening process. There isn’t a machine that can duplicate what he and I can do together. We’re mobile and responsive and that nose of his can’t be beat. Think of it this way. When your mom is cooking soup and you come home – what do you smell? You smell soup. The dog smells the salt and pepper in the broth. He smells the carrots, the chicken and every other ingredient in the soup. That sensitive nose can smell more than delicious food though. It can also detect the materials that make up explosives.

TSA K-9’s undergo extensive training at the Lackland Air force base in San Antonio, TX, before being assigned to a permanent partner. Once that happens, the K-9s live with their handlers as part of their families. The handlers and dogs must develop a strong bond of trust and knowledge of each other to help handlers identify those subtle nuances their partner may exhibit when doing a search. My partnership with Doc has truly given me a worthy partner and a best friend. I spend more time with Doc than anyone else in my life. We work together, live together, and even go on vacation together!

It’s an honor to be a K-9 handler with Doc. Our mission makes a difference every single day. Most people don’t realize that without our efforts, multiple things would come to a halt at the airports and transportation systems across the nation. While extremely cute, our partner’s noses are also an extremely important tool in the fight against terrorism.",tsa
"CBP Commissioner R. Gil Kerlikowske looks on during a Change of Command ceremony honoring new Academy Chief Dan M. Harris, Jr., on July 20, 2016 in Artesia, N.M.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner R. Gil Kerlikowske recently named Chief Dan M. Harris, Jr., as the new Chief of the U.S. Border Patrol Academy in Artesia, N.M.

During a Change of Command ceremony at the New Mexico academy, Commissioner Kerlikowske honored Chief Harris for his continued commitment to the Border Patrol, and to training the next generation of agents.

“Providing top notch professional training to new Border Patrol Agents is of the utmost importance,” said Commissioner Kerlikowske.  “Under Chief Harris’ steady head, I am confident that the Academy will continue to serve as the finest foundation for producing the best-qualified agents to keep our nation and its border safe and secure.”

Commissioner Kerlikowske, CBP Chief Mark Morgan and Chief Dan M. Harris, Jr. stand in formation during the Change of Command Ceremony July 20, 2016 in Artesia, N.M.

Since September 2004, CBP has merged its training of new agents at the Artesia location as part of the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers (FLETC) Office of Artesia Operations (OAO).

The Artesia location is one of three FLETC residential training sites in the United States. Named for the town where it is located in the heart of southeast New Mexico’s oil and dairy belt, the 3,620-acre site includes a full range of facilities for conducting basic and advanced law enforcement training.

Commissioner Kerlikowske and Chief Mark Morgan talk to Border Patrol Agent interns in Artesia, N.M.

To maintain the high standards of Border Patrol Agents across the United States, the Border Patrol Agent basic training curriculum is undergoing an update in order to utilize the most effective methods and tools available.

The new training curriculum incorporates recommendations from several Use of Force Reviews, the 21st Century Policing Report, the CBP Integrity Advisory Panel report, and also Non-Governmental Organizations.  Training will be performance-based, in realistic training environments, with increased focus on safe tactics, de-escalation strategies, and communication techniques.

Under Chief Harris’ command, the U.S. Border Patrol Academy will continue to serve as a reminder of the success of DHS and the FLETC OAO’s ability to train those who protect our homeland.",tsa
"Today, Deputy Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas reflected on the state of cybersecurity at DHS and the implications of the new Presidential Policy Directive (PPD) on Cyber Incident Coordination at the International Conference on Cybersecurity in New York. The PPD was announced by Lisa Monaco, Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, at the same conference earlier in the week. 

 

Deputy Secretary Mayorkas called the issuance of the directive a “seminal” moment for cybersecurity and laid out the important role DHS plays in securing the nation’s critical assets, under the new directive.  The PPD spells out the lines of responsibility within the federal government for responses to a significant cyber incident, and specifies who to contact in the government in the event of an incident. DHS is unique among federal agencies in that we have responsibilities in both threat response – investigating the crime - and asset response – helping the victim(s) and identifying the point of vulnerability.



""The asset response is a very different framework because what it is designed to do is to identify the nature of the attack, to expel the harm,"" said the Deputy Secretary.





Threats in cyber space are unlike traditional crimes because they can easily be automated and reproduced, making asset response critical to keeping the nation safe.  Put simply, the more quickly we fix vulnerability, the less likely the damage will spread to other victims.



With this in mind, DHS is working towards fully automated information sharing among federal entities and private sector partners.  Deputy Secretary Mayorkas acknowledged that while this approach may be “antithetical to normal threat response, the sharing of information is critical in the cyber world.”  In fact, effective asset response depends on efficient, rapid, information-sharing about the incident.



Under the PPD, DHS will also take a lead role in drafting a National Cyber Incident Response Plan.



“We’ll take a page out of FEMA’s playbook,” explained the Deputy Secretary, in creating a plan to describe how the federal government will work with the private sector and state, local, and territorial governments in responding to a large-scale cyber incident. That plan will be ready in September.

Through a national campaign that began last July, we’ve worked hard to promote greater awareness of the rights, benefits and responsibilities of U.S. citizenship. An estimated 8.8 million lawful permanent residents are currently eligible to apply for citizenship. The Citizenship Public Education and Awareness Campaign enabled us to reach out to many of them with information about how to become a U.S. citizen and the free study materials available from USCIS.

Due to the growing need for reliable information about citizenship, we released the first set of digital ads in four states last summer. In the fall, we ran digital and print ads in the 10 states with 75 percent of the lawful permanent resident population: California, New York, Texas, Florida, New Jersey, Illinois, Massachusetts, Virginia, Washington and Arizona. Ads appeared in English, Spanish, Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean and Tagalog. We ran ads for a third time earlier this year in the same 10 states, along with new Facebook ads which expanded our reach. The campaign generated over a million clicks and nearly two million page views online and reached 19 million people through our print ads.

We couldn’t have done it alone. We would like to thank the many organizations that helped us promote the campaign across the country, ensuring it was a success. These include state and local governments, federal agencies and nongovernmental organizations.  The year-long effort succeeded in increasing visits to our Citizenship Resource Center , which provides detailed information and tools to assist with the naturalization process.  But informing the public about the benefits and meaning of U.S. citizenship is central to the USCIS mission, and we will continue to do that moving forward.

"This month, the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) Blue Campaign is marking an important milestone - six years of work to combat human trafficking in the United States. Since 2010, the Blue Campaign has served as the unified voice for the Department’s efforts to combat human trafficking.

Throughout the past year, we have made significant strides in our efforts to raise public consciousness of human trafficking across the United States, through law enforcement trainings, public awareness materials, and resources for both government and private sector partners.

The Blue Campaign recently expanded our suite of tools and resources. In the coming year, we plan to release a new Public Service Announcement, as well as new awareness materials depicting the different types of human trafficking and its many victims in communities across the United States.

In the past year, the Blue Campaign has greatly increased the number of people who can recognize the signs of human trafficking through training and educational materials. For the first time, the DHS Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers (FLETC) included human trafficking awareness training in its basic training courses for over 90 federal law enforcement agencies.  We also introduced online awareness materials for Native American communities, DHS employees, and different industries; and trained hundreds of airline personnel through the Blue Lightning Initiative. Through our train-the-trainer programs, we hope to reach even more people in the coming year.

The Blue Campaign is proud to stand alongside many others in this fight, because no one combats human trafficking alone. In the past year, we entered nine formal partnerships with the North Dakota Public Health Association; the Houston Mayor’s Office; the Birmingham, Alabama Mayor’s Office; the California Hotel and Lodging Association; the San Joaquin Regional Rail Commission; the D.C. Office of Human Rights; and the Virginia Office of the Attorney General. In the coming year, we hope to add even more partners that can help spread awareness across the country and increase the number of individuals, families, and communities across the nation who have learned to recognize and report human trafficking.

Yesterday, the Department of Homeland Security concluded its first ever two-day hiring event aimed at filling mission-critical positions to protect our Nation’s cyberspace. Several thousand people attended this innovative hiring event, which marked the first time eligible candidates could interview for an opening, receive a tentative job offer, and initiate the security process – all on the spot.

DHS was able to expedite the hiring process, interview hundreds of potential candidates, and immediately extend tentative job offers to over 150 talented entrepreneurs, computer scientists, engineers, and problem solvers. DHS employees also hosted an exhibition hall, where visitors were able to learn about how cyber and tech professionals support the DHS mission.  In addition to the exhibition hall, we held several “Find and Apply” and “Improving your Federal Resume” sessions.  Each session provided a great opportunity for participants to learn more on the Federal hiring process.  Over 400 employees from across DHS volunteered for the event and helped make it a success.

Deputy Secretary Mayorkas and Deputy Under Secretary for Management/Chief Financial Officer, Chip Fulghum participate in a cyber demonstration at one of the several Component exhibits.

Deputy Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas greets DHS employees and visitors at the DHS Cyber and Tech Job Fair, July 27.

"This weekend, we recognize and celebrate the 227th anniversary of the U.S. Customs Service.

The U.S. Customs Service, the legacy agency of our current U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency, which was established by President George Washington on July 31, 1789.

Two of the first Collectors of Customs (now called “Commissioners”) were Generals Lincoln (Boston) and Lamb (New York).

The U.S. Customs Service holds an important place in our nation’s history: For its first 100 years, the Service was the primary source of funds for the growing U.S. government.

The U.S. Customs Service closed when the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency was established in 2003 as the nation’s first comprehensive border security agency, and the Commissioner and the majority of the Customs Service staff joined CBP at that time.

CBP continues to honor the rich legacy of the U.S. Customs Service by maintaining the integrity of our nation’s ports and borders. Learn more about CBP and its origins in the U.S. Customs Service here.",tsa
"The Department of Homeland Security ensures that our Nation and its people are safe, secure, and resilient against terrorism and other hazards.

Last week, more than 2,600 personnel from the Department of Homeland Security ensured the safety and security of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. They started their work only hours after completing the same task at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland.

The U.S. Coast Guard rescued 46 people after their ship sank off the coast of Alaska. U.S. Customs and Border Protection arrested suspected human smugglers off the coast of Florida.  NPPD took the lead on developing a new National Cyber Incident Response Plan for cyberattacks. TSA discovered 74 firearms in carry-on bags. And USCIS naturalized hundreds of new citizens.

And that was just last week.

Every single day, across the country and around the world, the dedicated men and women of the Department of Homeland Security keep our nation secure, and our people safe.

Whether they’re protecting our borders, ensuring our cybersecurity, preventing terrorist attacks, or enforcing our immigration laws: the incredible work the 229,000 employees of DHS do each day is not always recognized, but it is always vital.

We celebrate our accomplishments. We honor our personnel. And we continue to do what is hard, in order to keep our nation safe. That’s all in a day at DHS.

"Human trafficking is a crime that affects victims of any age, gender, race, or immigration status. Human trafficking occurs in all parts of this country – from cities, to suburbs, to rural areas. Perpetrators of this crime relentlessly canvass ways to take advantage of people who find themselves in circumstances of extreme adversity or violence, experience discrimination, economic vulnerability, or dependence.

This summer, the Blue Campaign introduced a new phase of its national campaign to raise awareness of the full reach of this crime and promote new and innovative web-based educational resources to reach all communities across the U.S. Our new posters, depicted below, are available for download here.

"The Middle Eastern Law Enforcement Officers Association (MELOA), a new group comprised of DHS employees that works to build trust through community engagement, held their first annual conference.

Secretary Jeh Johnson traveled to Dearborn where he spoke about the Department’s commitment to communities.

“It has been proven, time and again, that a law enforcement community, a police force, a law enforcement organization that looks like the community that they serve builds trust,” said Secretary Johnson. “When I look around this room at all the people who work for DHS, I have tremendous optimism for our future.”

Middle Eastern Americans are woven into the fabric of our country – and our Department. At DHS, they proudly serve as Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, watch commanders at Customs and Border Protection, serve as Coast Guard cadets, provide disaster recovery support at FEMA, and screen passengers at TSA. The diversity of our workforce reflects the diversity of our nation, and it strengthens our ability at DHS to keep the American people safe.

Since our last visit to Dearborn in January, MELOA’s membership has increased by five hundred percent. Secretary Johnson affirmed MELOA’s work to promote trust and encouraged the organization to continue growing.

In the evolving threat environment, there has never been a more important time to build bridges to local communities. While groups like ISIL and al-Qaeda seek to divide us, the DHS Office for Community Partnerships will continue to promote dialogue and understanding, building the partnerships that safeguard our nation and our values.

"On August 18, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson was in Baton Rouge, Louisiana to meet with state and local officials and to review and survey response and recovery efforts in areas affected by severe flooding. He was accompanied by Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Deputy Administrator Joseph Nimmich.

“The federal government is here.  We have been here.  We will be here as long as it takes to  help this community recover.”

Secretary Johnson met with Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards and members of the Governor’s cabinet team.  U.S.  Representatives Cedric Richmond and Garret Graves joined Secretary Johnson to view local shelters, meet with volunteers, and view  damage.

Secretary Johnson visited the Lamar Dixon Displacement Shelter, operated by the Red Cross where workers are providing meals, safe sleeping arrangements, and emotional support to those with immediate, disaster-caused needs.

Secretary Johnson then traveled to Ascension to view areas impacted by widespread flooding caused by recent torrential rains. FEMA has been on the ground in the region since before the flooding began and continues to mobilize across the state to respond to emergency needs and to assist with recovery including getting people into temporary housing.  Already more than 95,000 have registered for individual assistance. Over 22,000 have filed flood claims.  FEMA has over 1,100 personnel on the ground, including 560 housing inspectors and hundreds more on the way. Over $16.7 million has already been approved for temporary housing, emergency repairs for disaster survivors.

In Baton Rouge, Secretary Johnson visited the Louisiana State Emergency Operations Center where he was briefed on flood recovery efforts and met with Operations Center personnel.

While at the Louisiana State Emergency Operations Center, Secretary Johnson participated in a press availability alongside Governor John Bel Edwards, Rep. Cedric Richmond, and CEO of the American Red Cross Gail McGovern. Secretary Johnson highlighted the ongoing relief efforts by FEMA and the U.S. Coast Guard in support of the state of Louisiana.

The U.S. Coast Guard is conducting air and surface rescue operations, which have thus far assisted more than 3,000 people, saved 245 lives, and 71 pets, and continues to actively support ground operations.

Residents and business owners who sustained disaster-related losses can apply for assistance by registering online at www.DisasterAssistance.gov, or calling 1-800-621-FEMA (3362).

"Today marks an important step in attracting the world’s best and brightest entrepreneurs to start the next generation of great companies and create jobs here in the United States. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is publishing a proposed International Entrepreneur Rule, which describes new ways in which DHS will facilitate the ability of certain promising startup founders to begin growing their companies within the United States, contingent on factors such as significant financing from U.S. investors.

Immigrant entrepreneurs have always made exceptional contributions to America’s economy, in communities all across the country. Immigrants have helped start as many as one of every four small businesses and high-tech startups across America, and the majority of high-tech startups in Silicon Valley. Studies suggest that more than 40 percent of Fortune 500 companies were founded by immigrants or the children of immigrants.

Dr. Karen Lozano is one of these immigrants. She came to the United States to pursue graduate work in mechanical engineering and materials science, and was the first Mexican native to graduate with a PhD in engineering from Rice University. Dr. Lozano went on to join the faculty of the University of Texas-Pan American (now the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley) and to co-invent a process for spinning nanofibers exponentially faster than other technologies on the market. The company she co-founded to commercialize this technology, FibeRio, generated sales on five continents and 40 advanced manufacturing jobs close to home.

We need more ways to ensure that people like Dr. Lozano are creating jobs and growing the economy here in the United States. That is why creating a “startup visa” for international entrepreneurs has always been a part of the President’s commonsense immigration reform principles, and was part of the bipartisan immigration bill that passed the Senate in 2013. And while there is no substitute for legislation, the Administration is taking the steps it can within existing legal authorities to fix as much of our broken immigration system as possible. The administrative reforms announced by the President in November 2014, if fully implemented, could boost the nation’s economic output by up to $250 billion, while shrinking the federal deficit by $65 billion over the next ten years.

Today’s proposed International Entrepreneur Rule is one of these reforms. DHS is proposing clear criteria to identify on a case-by-case basis entrepreneurs who would provide significant public benefit to the United States, based on factors including the entrepreneur’s ownership stake and leadership role; the growth potential of the startup; competitive research grants from federal, state, and local government agencies; and investment by qualified American investors. The proposed rule would allow such entrepreneurs to remain in the United States for an initial period of up to two years, followed by one additional period of up to three years contingent on meeting certain additional benchmarks.

Once this rule is finalized, it will provide much-needed clarity for entrepreneurs who have been validated by experienced American funders, and who demonstrate substantial potential for rapid growth and job creation.

The proposed rule is open for public comment for 45 days, allowing stakeholders to provide valuable feedback to DHS before the final rule is ultimately published. (We encourage you to read the details and submit your comments.)

The International Entrepreneur Rule will complement other Administration efforts to attract talented startup founders from around the world, including the Entrepreneur Pathways resource to help entrepreneurs navigate the immigration system, a key deliverable of the Entrepreneurs in Residence program that recruited entrepreneurs to help streamline DHS policies and practices to better reflect the realities faced by entrepreneurs and startups. DHS will also publish guidance to clarify when entrepreneurs may self-petition for lawful permanent residence (also known as a “green card”).

America must remain a beacon for entrepreneurs like Tom Szaky, who left his home in Hungary following the Chernobyl disaster, and ultimately moved to the United States to study at Princeton University. In his sophomore year, he started TerraCycle in his dorm room with the mission of recycling materials previously viewed as unrecyclable. Today, the 150-person New Jersey-based company collects trash in 24 countries and two thirds of public schools in America, and recycles over one million pounds of garbage per week that would otherwise be in a landfill.

As President Obama said in his final State of the Union address, “America is every immigrant and entrepreneur from Boston to Austin to Silicon Valley, racing to shape a better world. That’s who we are.”",tsa
"On August 26, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson was in Atlanta, Georgia to deliver the keynote address at the Morehouse College Crown Forum. The lecture series provides the means by which students may begin to meet the challenge of developing to their highest potential and form a partnership with the academic program to foster a well-rounded college education.

Upon arrival in Atlanta, Secretary Johnson stopped by KIPP WAYS Academy, and met with students who showed them their hard work in the classroom, before hearing from him about the hard work going on at the Department.

After his walking tour of KIPP WAYS Academy, the Secretary then headed to Morehouse.

Secretary Johnson ‘79, a Morehouse Man himself, discussed issues of the day with former classmate and current President John S. Wilson, and touched on the values Acuity, Integrity, Agency, Brotherhood and Consequence that he continues to carry with him today.

Following his remarks, Secretary Johnson participated in a lunch with students, and shared memories from his time walking the very same streets and halls as they do today.

After an afternoon of swapping stories, Secretary Johnson made a final stop to Atlanta-Hartsfield International Airport where he met with Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed, Transportation Security Administration Federal Security Director Mary Leftridge-Byrd for a briefing and demonstration of the new Innovation Lanes.

These innovations lanes allow customers to pass through five at a time at five automated stations in a row. People are able to move without having to wait in a single-file line moving only as fast as the person ahead.

Due to the added resource provided by the innovation lanes, and hard work from the Transportation Security Administration workforce, wait times are estimated to have been reduced by 30%.

"Last week, I had the opportunity to present a challenge to some of the world’s most innovative tech experts and the aviation industry about global airport travel and the imperative before us to dramatically transform air travel and the traveler experience.

Standing before a group of one of the most tech-oriented communities in the world, I held up a stamp, a stapler and paper forms. These antiquated tools still serve actual functions in the process of admitting a traveler into the United States.

This needs to change if we are going to meet the demands of travelers, the aviation industry and ultimately the economy.  We must transform our Department’s processes in the air travel environment: at Preclearance locations in collaboration with our foreign partners, and domestically with international arrivals, biometric exit, and at the aviation security checkpoint.

At a forum hosted by Plug and Play in Sunnyvale, California, we met with innovators to invite government, the aviation industry, venture capitalists, big technology and startups to come together, dream of, and build a new international airport environment that meets the demands we face in the international travel environment.

In the airport environment, we are facing a convergence moment where in the near future year-over-year growth in travel, limited improvements in physical airport infrastructure and ever-present security threats will force change.

I was encouraged by the discussion and the dialogue among the participants and the eagerness to take on the challenge we face.  Working together, a solution that combines biometrics, real-time management of the flows of travelers within the airport, and a seamless mobile experience that can guide passengers through their journey is not only achievable, but necessary if we are to continue to grow the U.S. travel and tourism industry while continuing to ensure security.

We must work together now to shape the best travel experience before a less-desirable outcome is forced upon us.",tsa
"On Saturday evening, Secretary Johnson spoke at the Islamic Society of North America’s 53rd Annual Convention in Chicago—making him the first sitting Cabinet Secretary and highest-ranking U.S. Government official to personally address the convention.

Secretary Johnson spoke to the audience of American Muslims not as Secretary of Homeland Security, but as a fellow American.

“Tonight I will not look at this large group of Muslims before me in this room through a homeland security lens. Tonight I will not talk to you about counterterrorism. Tonight I will simply address you as who you are, ‘my fellow Americans.’”

American Muslims have a long and proud history in the United States. They have been an integral part of our communities, as entrepreneurs, scientists, athletes, authors, public servants and members of our armed forces. Secretary Johnson has been steadfast in his commitment to build bridges to American Muslim communities, having personally met with leaders in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, rural Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, Detroit, Chicago, Columbus, Houston, Minneapolis, Dearborn, and Los Angeles.

Citing his family history, the Secretary affirmed that discrimination and vilification are not only contrary to our homeland security, but our values as Americans. At the height of the Red Scare, his own grandfather testified before the House Un-American Activities Committee, since abolished, to defend the patriotism of African-Americans.

“The House Un-American Activities Committee was abolished many years ago.  I’m told it used to hold its hearings in Room 311 of the Cannon House Office Building on Capitol Hill in Washington. This is the same room in which the House Homeland Security Committee holds its hearings today.  Therefore, sixty-seven years ago, my grandfather likely testified in that hearing room to defend his patriotism; now his grandson testifies in that same room to explain what the U.S. government is doing to defend our Nation. This is the promise and the wonder of this country.”

Secretary Johnson encouraged the young people in attendance to hold on to the promise and wonder of this country and continue to fully participate in our democracy. He closed his address with a simple, but important, message.

“Ladies and gentlemen, fellow Americans: public officials in this country are often reluctant to ask the public we serve for your help.  On behalf of myself and the President, I ask for your help.  Hear this message and share it with others in your communities.”

"Just before the beginning of summer, Secretary Johnson and TSA Administrator Neffenger set forth an aggressive plan for addressing wait times at the nation’s busiest airports without compromising aviation security. That was some 217 million passengers ago.

Speaking at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport on Wednesday, Secretary Johnson outlined the results:

“Through a lot of hard work by the frontlines of TSA represented by the people standing behind us and their leaders represented by Administrator Neffenger we reduced wait times without compromising security.”

“We expedited the hiring of 1,368 new TSOs. We converted 1,865 TSOs from part time to full time. We received great assistance from airport and airline personnel. Some 600 personnel contributed to the work at security checkpoints of a non-security nature. We brought on more canine teams for pass screening. TSOs from around the country volunteered to work at some of the nation’s busiest airports and redeployed to help out.”

“The result of all of this hard work is that this summer, 98.4% of the traveling public had a wait time of less than 30 minutes across the country. 92.1% had a wait time of less than 15 minutes. Members of TSA pre-check, 96.6% had a wait time of five minutes or less. Today, at our nation’s seven busiest airports, average wait time is less than 10 minutes.”

“In all, we should thank the men and women of TSA who every day work to keep the American public safe. My request to the public, next time you see a TSA officer at an airport at a checkpoint, just say thank you.”",tsa
"One of the Federal Protective Service’s (FPS) missions is to protect all Americans and their ability to peacefully demonstrate and protest. This past weekend, FPS and its law enforcement partners prepared for several large, planned public gatherings taking place in Portland, Ore. at the federally-owned Terry Shrunk Plaza and the adjacent city-owned Chapman Park, where citizens were planning to express their views, including two groups with opposing ideologies.

“Portland has had a noticeable increase in demonstrations between various groups over the last year,” said Gabriel Russell, the regional director for FPS Region 10.  “Response to events involving the many different groups has required a significant reliance on our strong relationship with the Portland Police Bureau, the Multnomah County Sheriff’s Department and the Oregon State Police to ensure each group is able to voice their views safely.”

After weeks of planning for the potential of these opposing groups to confront each other in the Portland area, FPS officers and law enforcement partners were able to hold the line between the multiple demonstration groups on Sunday, June 4.  The events at the Terry Shrunk Plaza and neighboring Chapman Park escalated quickly, turning violent as agitators from both groups began crossing the lines of separation to incite a reaction from the other group.

As FPS officers and local police tried to keep the peace, demonstrators began throwing items at them.  Once the events reached a fevered pitch and violence erupted, FPS and the Portland Police Bureau took quick action to keep people safe by closing the city park and shepherding demonstrators in another direction to allow for further separation between the two main groups.  Law enforcement officers deployed flash grenades and pepper ball munitions to help disperse the crowds.  As a result of the violence and civil disobedience, FPS arrested five individuals and the Portland Police Bureau arrested nine, in addition to confiscating countless prohibited items.

“By the end of the day, all parties had dispersed, no one was seriously injured, and the public was able to exercise the freedom of speech and go home safely,” said District Commander Luis Lopez, who oversees FPS protection operations in Portland.  “Our close relationship with the local law enforcement agencies and our joint planning and training truly paid off.”

The Federal Protective Service is the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s federal law enforcement agency responsible for protecting approximately 9,000 federal buildings across the country, and the people who visit or work in those facilities. As part of the National Protection and Programs Directorate, FPS ensures that federal property is protected against acts of violence, terrorism, and other hazards to ensure that the safe conduct of government operations and services to our citizens can continue.",tsa
"This year on September 11th, we pause to remember events that occurred fifteen years ago, events which prompted the formation of this Department.

We continue to commemorate 9/11 and, at the same time, move forward.  On Friday, September 9, we commemorated the federal government’s return to the new One World Trade Center in New York City. Those employees who report to work at the building will carry on the legacy of those who came before them, and commit their work every day to protecting our Nation.

Over the last fifteen years our government has become adept at detecting and preventing terrorist plots against the homeland from overseas. Through the good work of our military and others in national security, those involved in the 9/11 attacks are either dead or captured. Core al Qaeda has been seriously degraded. Meanwhile, a glittering new World Trade Center stands even taller than the old one, and the Pentagon has been rebuilt and modernized.  We continue to honor and remember those killed on 9/11, but we’ve come back stronger than before.

Fifteen years later the terrorism threat we now face has evolved. We’ve significantly improved our ability to prevent complex attacks like 9/11, which has forced terrorists to turn to less complicated acts of violence such as mass shootings.  It is this type of attack that we saw at San Bernardino, in Chattanooga, and in Orlando earlier this year.

So, what is your government doing about this?

For the President and his entire national security team, the safety of the American people and our homeland is our first priority. At President Obama’s direction, the U.S. military continues to take the fight to ISIL abroad. With our international partners, we’ve reduced ISIL’s territory in Iraq and Syria considerably, compared to two years ago, and the group has been unable to launch a major ground offensive in over a year. Just days ago in Syria, our special forces killed ISIL’s top external operations plotter and spokesman, Abu Muhammed al-Adnani. But overseas battlefield successes alone will not defeat the current terrorist threat.

At the federal level, we’ve taken a Whole of Community approach. We have strengthened our relationships with local law enforcement – working with some 1,800 local police departments around the country -- to improve the capacity of our state and local officials to support the homeland security mission.

The FBI continues to do an excellent job of detecting, investigating, and preventing terrorist plots in this country, while disrupting others trying to leave this country and join terrorist groups overseas. For state and local law enforcement, we support the acquisition of better first-responder, communications, surveillance and homeland security equipment. We have also strengthened our relationships with our foreign partners. As the President stated in the National Security Strategy of 2015, “In an interconnected world, there are no global problems that can be solved without the United States, and few that can be solved by the United States alone.

We’ve hardened the security around military and civilian government installations in this country.

We’ve doubled down on aviation and airport security, required enhanced screening at airports overseas with direct flights to the United States and enhanced TSA screening at domestic airports. As the public knows, screening enhancements coupled with increased travel volume led to longer wait times at security checkpoints earlier this summer.  But, with the expedited hiring of more full-time TSA officers and the addition of other resources, we’ve reduced wait times without compromising security.

We are expanding the capability to pre-clear passengers at overseas airports, enabling our security personnel to prevent suspicious persons from boarding flights bound for the U.S. This capability exists at 15 overseas airports and we plan to expand this important effort to more locations.

We’re doing more to disrupt the flow of foreign terrorist fighters in and out of Syria, Libya, and other areas of jihadist activity, and to prevent the travel of potential terrorists to and from this country. We’ve now built a state-of-the art capability to monitor known or suspected terrorists, and to track suspicious travel patterns of those we don’t already know. We’re providing these tools to foreign allies in Europe and elsewhere, and insisting they do more themselves to track the travel of potential terrorists and monitor their own borders. Within the last two years, we’ve greatly enhanced the security of our refugee resettlement program, and the program by which travelers from certain countries are able to enter this country from certain others without a visa.

In addition to law enforcement and security measures, we are working to prevent American citizens from falling prey to the hollow promises of terrorist recruitment campaigns. We are doing this by building bridges to communities across the country, including our American Muslim communities. In the current environment, this is critical to our homeland security mission. We must reach out to American communities that ISIL and other terrorist groups have targeted for recruitment so we can work together to protect Americans, especially young people, from such groups.

Finally, there is always a role for the public at large to play too.  “If You See Something, Say Something” is more than a slogan. Public vigilance and awareness can and do make a difference in preventing terrorist attacks.

All these efforts will take time. We’ve made considerable progress so far, but there is much more to do. Fifteen years after 9/11, the public should know that our armed forces, along with the men and women of our homeland security, law enforcement and intelligence agencies are working hard to keep the American people and the homeland safe.

On this day and all others, we recall our DHS mission: “With honor and integrity, we will safeguard the American people, our homeland and our values.”",tsa
"Fifteen years ago, on September 11, 2001, we witnessed the worst attack in our nation’s history. As we look back and remember the day that changed our nation forever, we come together to remember and also to look forward.

Secretary Johnson said, “It is a sign of our determination to move forward and to come back stronger than ever before. Literally out of the ashes, we have rebuilt stronger and taller.”

Secretary Johnson was joined by the Department’s leadership and employees, as well as federal, state, and local partners to commemorate this momentous day.

Speaking at the event, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said, “the federal government is back in strength here at the World Trade Center – a message to the entire world that we will never ever renounce our values or be afraid.”

U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) Administrator Denise Turner Roth also participated in the event. Apart from DHS, GSA is the only other federal tenant taking up residence inside the building. In all, over 900 federal employees will now come to work at One World Trade Center every day.

Michael Byrne, the Deputy Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) Region 2 also shared his experiences. Mike isn’t just a public servant – he is a lifelong New Yorker and a shining example of American resilience. He was part of the first fire company to respond in 1993 after the World Trade Center was bombed. On September 11, 2001, Mike, then working for FEMA, responded to Ground Zero to do what he could to help. In the aftermath of the attacks, Mike was part of the team that helped form the Department of Homeland Security. Now, he comes to work every day at One World Trade Center. ”When I come into the office here, I walk past the memorials remembering my lost friends and colleagues. And walking by, I’ll stop and look at some of the names of friends I knew. I remember the times we had together.”

On Sunday, Secretary Johnson joined other leaders and the families of the victims of September 11 during the ceremony at the National September 11 Memorial.

With each name read and each bell marking a moment of silence tolled, we are reminded that we are a nation of courageous, strong and resilient people.

9/11 changed our nation forever, but it did not change fundamental American values. The dedicated men and women of DHS will continue to work with honor and integrity to safeguard the American people, our homeland, and our values.",tsa

"U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is celebrating Constitution Day and Citizenship Day, observed on Sept. 17, and Constitution Week, with nearly 240 naturalization ceremonies across the country. From the steps of the Lincoln memorial to the shores of Ellis Island, more than 38,000 candidates will be, for the first time, addressed as fellow Americans.

Constitution Week is being recognized this year from Sept. 16-23. The annual commemoration honors the signing of the Constitution on Sept. 17, 1787, and an observance that began in 1940 as “I Am an American Day.”

During Constitution Week, we celebrate the connection between the Constitution and citizenship and reflect on what it means to be a citizen of the United States. A chorus of voices rang out today through the main chamber of Ellis Island, where over 12 million immigrants entered the United States between 1892 and 1954, and recited the Preamble from memory during a naturalization ceremony for 45 candidates for citizenship.

We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.

The Constitution plays a meaningful role in the lives of new Americans. It not only establishes the rule of law, but also creates the framework for an immigration system that enables immigrants to become full citizens with the same rights, privileges and responsibilities as any other.

USCIS has partnered with NPS to hold more than 100 naturalization ceremonies in national parks and historic sites this year as a part of NPS’ centennial celebration. The partnership with NPS was established in 2006 to honor our nation’s history and the places NPS is charged to protect. Picturesque and quintessentially American places where naturalization ceremonies were held this Constitution Week inspire new citizens and those who witness naturalization ceremonies to celebrate and experience our country’s history and natural beauty, and to protect it for future generations.",tsa
"Over six decades, more than 12 million immigrants came through Ellis Island. Today, 298 people sat in the same place under the American flag and become new U.S. citizens during a naturalization ceremony in the Great Hall. We welcome and celebrate our newest fellow Americans in honor of Citizenship Day and Constitution Week.

"At the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), we fight against the world’s toughest cyber adversaries. They attack at the speed of light, rapidly changing their tactics -- and targets -- to exploit new vulnerabilities and new technology. We are constantly challenged to keep up with these adversaries and defend the safety and security of the American people – the highest stakes.

Our best weapon is our people. So today, we are sharing two videos with you to help us meet this mission.

The first we call “Months to Milliseconds” because it depicts how we are moving to fight at the speed of the machines and networks we protect. It shows the work my team does inside our National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center to protect federal networks and provides a realistic scenario that captures our daily life in cybersecurity operations at DHS.

A full transcript of the Months to Milliseconds video, including all audio and visual information, can be found here.

In the second, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson and I discuss the importance of public service and the challenges and opportunities of our work at DHS on cybersecurity.

A full transcript of the DHS Cybersecurity Jobs video, including all audio and visual information, can be found here.

To keep up with the adversary, we need talented public servants to deploy cutting edge technology, focus on emerging threats, and develop innovative solutions with partners inside and outside government.

If you are a cybersecurity professional, if you have energy, creativity, and passion, we want you to join us.

Through the DHS Cybersecurity Workforce Initiative, the Department is hiring a diverse group of cybersecurity professionals to secure the nation’s digital assets and critical infrastructure. That includes computer engineers, scientists, analysts, and Information Technology specialists.

We need the best and brightest to do a tour of duty at DHS. The work we do and the ideas you will bring are essential to our nation’s way of life. At DHS, we work on all parts of the security process – from penetration testing to malware analysis to network clean-up. Here, you can do things that will put you at the forefront of our nation’s security – working on projects you will not see anywhere else - and have access to cutting-edge technology and challenges from all of our components such as the U.S. Coast Guard, Immigration and Customs Enforcement Homeland Security Investigations, and the U.S. Secret Service.

Working at DHS is a great career move. I know because I got my start working for a private company, and I have learned volumes from my time at DHS. Every day, every level of my team is working side-by-side with partners in law enforcement, top-tier research institutions, and major private sector companies. Regardless of where your career takes you, this shared experience will make you stronger and take your skills to new heights.  And it is good for the nation as a whole.

At DHS, we are at the frontlines of cyberspace, defending the homeland and our connected world.   Whether you want to have a career in government, the private sector or both, join us as we say: “With honor and integrity, we will safeguard the American people, our homeland, and our values.”",tsa
"The Department of Homeland Security is honored to wish Transportation Security Administration (TSA) explosives detection canine Ssiller a happy retirement. Ssiller retired Sunday after working for six years to keep the traveling public safe at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport.

Ssiller has worked exclusively with Transportation Security Inspector Christopher Neeson, who is adopting the dog to keep as a pet in his retirement. Neeson will be training for 12 weeks with a new canine partner at TSA’s National Canine Training Center in San Antonio, Texas, to bring back to work at JFK Airport.

“Ssiller has been an ideal partner,” Neeson said. “It’s going to be a big change for him in retirement, one that he deserves for so many years of service to the mission. I imagine he’ll miss working in the airport.""

Ssiller and Neeson visit the World Trade Center Memorial to pay respects to Stephen G. Siller, the fallen fire fighter who is the dog’s namesake. (TSA photo)

Ssiller was named after Stephen G. Siller, a Brooklyn firefighter who, on September 11, 2001 lost his life saving others after the attack on the World Trade Center. TSA canines named after those who died on 9/11 carry two identical first letters to start their names, like Ssiller.

Ssiller, we thank you for your dedication to the DHS mission as the namesake of an American hero. We wish you all the best in your retirement!",tsa
"Over the last seven years, our nation has experienced increasingly severe and significant cyber incidents affecting both the private sector and Federal Government. The U.S. government’s experience responding to cyber incidents such as those that affected Sony Pictures Entertainment and the Office of Personnel Management has taught us valuable lessons and highlighted areas of growth.

To codify those lessons learned, in July, President Obama issued Presidential Policy Directive 41 (PPD-41): United States Cyber Incident Coordination. The directive called for a National Cyber Incident Response Plan (NCIRP) that defines a nationwide approach to cyber incidents and outlines the roles of both federal and non-federal entities. It also outlines how the U.S. government prepares for, responds to, and recovers from significant cyber incidents. And it responds to calls we’ve heard from the private sector to provide clarity and guidance about the Federal Government’s roles and responsibilities, including an answer to the question, “who do I call to report cyber incidents and get help?”

No single federal agency possesses all of the authorities, capabilities, and expertise to deal unilaterally with a significant cyber incident, so PPD-41 breaks down cyber incident response into three roles: asset response, threat response, and intelligence support to both of those activities. Asset response focuses on helping the organization affected by malicious cyber activity find the bad guys on their network, kick them off, and recover. Threat response focuses on identifying, pursuing, and disrupting the bad guys and their activity. As an analogy, think of a significant cyber incident as an arson: when you have a fire caused by arson, you want both the firefighters and the police to be present. The firefighters’ role is to put out the fire: that’s asset response. The police’s role is to determine who set the fire and bring them to justice: that’s threat response.

The Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) is the designated lead for asset response during a significant cyber incident. They are the firefighters: they will find the bad guy on the affected organization’s system and help remove them, determine how they gained access, assess the damage, and provide guidance to the organization on how to make their system more secure. The NCCIC will also identify and alert other organizations that may be at risk from this particular bad guy, share anonymized information about the incident as broadly as possible so that other organizations can protect themselves, and distribute threat indicators related to the incident through our Automated Indicator Sharing capability so that our partners can immediately mitigate this particular threat.

The Department of Justice—specifically, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force (NCIJTF)—is the lead federal agency responsible for threat response in the event of a significant cyber incident. The FBI and NCIJTF are like the police in our arson analogy: they will conduct appropriate law enforcement and national security investigative activity; identify, pursue, and attempt to apprehend the bad guy; and disrupt and deter malicious cyber activity. DHS also plays a role in threat response: our U.S. Secret Service investigates financial crimes, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations provides threat response for cyber-enabled crimes.

Finally, intelligence support efforts involve creating situational awareness about cyber threats. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), through its Cyber Threat

Intelligence Integration Center (CTIIC), is the lead federal agency for intelligence support during significant cyber incidents. The CTIIC does not work directly with organizations that experience cyber incidents, rather it supports the government effort.

Recognizing that cybersecurity is a shared responsibility and effective cyber incident response must involve all levels of government as well as the private sector, PPD-41 directs DHS to develop an NCIRP. Over the past few months, DHS has coordinated with stakeholders from across the Federal Government; state, local, tribal and territorial governments; and the private sector to develop a draft NCIRP. Today, that draft is available for a 30-day public comment period, and can be viewed at www.us-cert.gov/ncirp.

Building upon PPD-41, the NCIRP outlines the roles and responsibilities of federal, state, local, tribal, territorial, private sector, and international stakeholders during a cyber incident; identifies the core capabilities required in the event of a cyber incident; and describes the coordination structure the Federal Government will use to coordinate its activities with affected stakeholders.

We welcome and encourage feedback on the draft NCIRP and are excited to promote it during National Cyber Security Awareness Month this October. Comments and questions will be accepted through October 31, 2016 and information about providing feedback accompanies the draft plan.. We will adjudicate public comments in November and December and plan to submit the final draft of the NCIRP to the White House in January 2017.

"DHS is honored to wish U.S. Customs and Border Protection canine Jasper a fond farewell and happy retirement.

Jasper began his service in CBP’s Beagle Brigade in 2011 when he was donated from the Columbia County Humane Society in Georgia.  He attended the U.S. Department of Agriculture Canine Academy in Orlando, Florida to learn how to detect harmful plant and animal products entering the country. After graduation he was assigned to the John F. Kennedy International Airport where he has spent his entire six-year career.

Jasper had 17,167 total seizures. The most memorable of these discoveries being whale meat, a goat’s head, and rhinoceros skin to name a few. One of Jasper’s plant seizures even resulted in changing the regulation governing the importation of citrus fruit from the Dominican Republic!

He will spend his retirement with his closest human friend and colleague, CBP Agriculture K-9 Specialist Amanda Tripple, whom adopted him.

At the end of his last shift, Jasper took off his CBP vest for the final time and was afforded a treat forbidden to working dogs: his former CBP colleagues were allowed to pet him.

For serving the Department and his country with distinction, we wish Jasper many more pets and a happy retirement. Congrats Jasper!",tsa
"October is National Cyber Security Awareness Month, which provides an opportunity to have a national conversation about the growing importance of cybersecurity and staying safe online.

There is no doubt that we are all leading increasingly digital lives. Almost everything we do now touches the Internet – from shopping and banking online, to connecting with friends and loved ones, to finding our way around a new town or city. However, there may be uncertainty among many Americans over how to best protect themselves online. Advances in technology have dramatically changed the way Americans lead their lives for the better but also pose a new set of security risks. Identity theft, phishing attempts, and cyberbullying are just a few examples of cyber incidents we now face. It is critical that all individuals make choices every day to be safer online.

Protecting yourself online may seem like a daunting task, but in reality it is not. There are simple, every day steps you can take to secure your online life. You don’t have to be a computer expert to take measures to stay safe online.

The Department of Homeland Security encourages you to follow these three simple steps below.

Join us in recognizing National Cyber Security Awareness Month throughout the month of October. Please visit www.dhs.gov/national-cyber-security-awareness-month or www.dhs.gov/StopThinkConnect for more information.",tsa
"Department of Homeland Security (DHS) personnel have an immense responsibility: every day, we safeguard the American people, our homeland, and our values.  It is this important calling that has driven so many to enter the DHS workforce, committing their life’s work to something greater than themselves. And it is my great honor to support DHS employees in the work that they do each day.

So far, over 6,000 DHS employees have gone above and beyond the call of duty, joining the DHS Surge Capacity Force. Members of the DHS Surge Capacity Force are non-emergency DHS personnel from across the Department who sign up to deploy to a disaster in the event that our Nation experiences an event so catastrophic that even the resources of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) are overwhelmed.

Since its creation, the DHS Surge Capacity Force has deployed only once.  In October 2012, in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, DHS activated the Surge Capacity Force, sending more than 1,100 DHS employees to assist FEMA with response and recovery efforts in New York and New Jersey.  But we know that we are only one bad day away from needing to activate the DHS Surge Capacity Force again.  For that reason, we work each day to recruit more DHS employees to join this important initiative, and train them to be at their best for communities that have been through the worst.

Surge Capacity Force volunteers are permanent and temporary full-time DHS employees who sign up to help FEMA in support of state and local response and recovery efforts.  By increasing our ability to “surge”, we as a Department and as a Nation become better prepared for catastrophic disasters of all kinds.

Surge Capacity Force volunteers are driven by the same spirit that brought them into government service in the first place: a desire to help and the knowledge that their work is making a real difference in the lives of others.",tsa
"Secretary John Kelly made his first trip to Canada as Secretary of Homeland Security last week and met with his counterparts across the Canadian cabinet.

His first stop in Ottawa was at the U.S. Embassy and a meeting with Chargé d’Affaires Elizabeth Aubin and Embassy staff.

The DHS workforce carries out our mission at home and abroad, and while at the U.S. Embassy, Secretary Kelly had the opportunity to meet with DHS employees supporting the DHS mission in Ottawa. Secretary Kelly, a retired Marine Corps General, was also honored to meet U.S. Marines who guard the U.S. Embassy

Secretary Kelly met with Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness Ralph Goodale to discuss priority matters pertaining to our shared Northern border, such as the 400,000 people and $2.4 billion in trade that cross every day.

Secretary Kelly also held discussions with Minister of Transport Marc Garneau, Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Ahmed D. Hussen, and Minister of Foreign Affairs Chrystia Freeland on additional important areas of Canada-U.S. mutual interest including aviation security, law enforcement collaboration, infrastructure, and immigration, refugee and visa policy.

While in Ottawa, Secretary Kelly presented flowers at the Canadian Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.

"The United States and Canada recently held the first joint nuclear forensics exercise between the two countries, in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.  The exercise simulated a nuclear detonation, allowing experts from both countries to improve operational readiness to respond to radiological or nuclear attacks.  The advancement of international cooperation in nuclear forensics will help improve the ability of the U.S. and its allies to determine the source of a detonated device.

During the exercise, the United States Government’s National Technical Nuclear Forensics Ground Collection Task Force deployed to Canada at their request and practiced collecting samples of simulated nuclear debris near the site of the hypothetical detonation. This highly specialized task force is equipped to conduct collections in radioactive environments and includes scientists and experts in the fields of nuclear forensics, evidence collection, hazardous material, contamination control, and health physics. In the case of an actual event, these samples would be transported to designated U.S. laboratories for forensic analysis.  Nuclear forensics conclusions inform intelligence and law enforcement operations in determining those responsible for the attack.  These conclusions also help prevent further attacks from occurring.

This exercise was the culmination of an 18-month effort between the governments of the United States and Canada. Particularly, the close collaboration between DHS’s Domestic Nuclear Detection Office and the Canadian Department of National Defence, Canadian Joint Operations Command, Joint Task Force Atlantic, and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police helped make this exercise a success. DHS also worked closely with the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration, the Department of State, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation throughout the planning and conduct of the exercise.

It is U.S. policy to hold fully accountable any state or non-state actor that willfully supports, enables, or engages in hostile nuclear activities that target or threaten the United States or our allies and partners.  Nuclear forensics enables this policy by providing the scientific basis for identifying perpetrators and sponsors of nuclear terrorism.

The DHS Domestic Nuclear Detection Office serves as the national integrator for the United States’ nuclear forensics capabilities and, along with its partners, helps ensure that these capabilities are ready to respond to an event on the homeland or anywhere around the world.",tsa
"We have not seen a hurricane this strong in almost a decade. It has already devastated Haiti, and has been building strength on its way to the U.S. As it makes landfall in Florida tonight and tracks up the eastern coastline over the coming days, Americans living in its path can expect to see life-threatening hurricane conditions, storm surges, tropical force winds, heavy rains, and all the devastation that that may bring.

Today, President Obama declared a state of emergency in Florida. Evacuations for coastal counties in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina are in effect. If you live in these areas, please listen to the directions of your state, tribal, and local officials. If instructed to evacuate, don't wait. You can always repair and rebuild -- and we'll be here to help you do that. The most important thing you can do is keep you and your family safe.

You can download the FEMA mobile app for shelter information, disaster resources, weather alerts, and safety tips, in English and in Spanish.

As a native Floridian, I am intimately aware of the devastation hurricanes can wreak. As the head of FEMA, it is my job to make sure that we do everything we can to prepare our communities for the oncoming storm and ensure that our emergency response efforts are ready to go as soon as we're needed.

That's why we've deployed teams to emergency operation centers in Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia to support preparation activities and ensure that no needs are unmet. We are staffing bases in Albany, Georgia, and Fort Bragg, North Carolina to collect and provide commodities and resources close to affected areas.

As of this morning, there were more than 414,000 liters of water, more than 513,700 meals, more than 8,000 blankets, and more than 20,600 cots in these locations. And more resources are on their way to Fort A.P. Hill, Virginia.

We're also coordinating with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to monitor and inspect the integrity of dams in the area. We're working with the U.S. Coast Guard to assess and advise on the status of ports. The Department of Health and Human Services has sent emergency medical specialists to Georgia to assist if needed.

Hurricane Matthew has potential for life-threatening rain, wind, and storm surges along our coast. This serves as a reminder for residents in areas at risk and around the nation to refresh their emergency kits and review family plans.

If you do not have an emergency kit or family plan, or if you want to learn about steps you can take now to prepare your family for severe weather, visit ready.gov.

And as you've undoubtedly seen, this hurricane has already taken a devastating toll on Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and countries in the Caribbean. We know that many people who didn't have a lot to begin with have lost almost everything. More than 100 people have lost their lives, and so many more are in need of substantial help.

If you want do what you can to help, please visit the Center for International Disaster Information, www.cidi.org, to find out how you can provide support to people when they need it most.

"If a cybercriminal tried to penetrate your office network, would you be able to recognize the hack?

As companies move more of their business operations online, cybercriminals are following them and looking to take advantage of unsuspecting employees to gain access to valuable company information.

Often, the weakest link in network cybersecurity is the human using a computer for work.

You have a very important role to play in cybersecurity. As seen in our “Months to Milliseconds” video, the responsibility for cybersecurity does not fall solely on the IT department. Everyone – from the entry-level employee to the CEO – has a responsibility to implement basic best practices.

As part of National Cyber Security Awareness Month 2016, we are focused on promoting a culture of cybersecurity at work. The first step: Educate and raise awareness for all employees. Here are simple actions you can take to protect information at home, on the go and at work:

DHS has a number of resources to help businesses and organizations improve their cybersecurity.  The C3 Voluntary Program supports industry in increasing cyber resilience, promotes awareness and use of the Cybersecurity Framework, and encourages organizations to manage cybersecurity as part of an all hazards approach. The Enhanced Cybersecurity Services (ECS) provides an intrusion prevention capability that helps U.S.-based companies protect their computer systems against unauthorized access, exploitation, and data exfiltration. Our Automated Indicator Sharing (AIS) is a free capability that enables the exchange of cyber threat indicators between the federal government and the private sector at machine speed.

Cybercriminals often prey on human error – such as employees clicking on a link in a phishing email or using a weak password – to gain access to an organization’s computer networks and information. I encourage you to take advantage of our tools and tips and help promote a culture of cybersecurity in your workplace.",tsa
"Today, the Administration issued new strategic guidance on federal efforts to counter violent extremism at home. This plan incorporates the many lessons we have learned over the years from working hand-in-hand with local communities and lays the groundwork for the years to come. The Strategic Implementation Plan to Empower Local Partners to Prevent Violent Extremism in the United States (PDF, 18 pages, 322 KB) will help ensure our Nation remains vigilant in preventing terrorists from recruiting and radicalizing Americans to violence.

Over the past several years, we have seen the threat of violent extremism evolve and with it, so has our response. We have seen ISIL attempt to inspire violence from afar through the Internet and social media. Meanwhile, events in Charleston and Baton Rouge show that violent extremism is not restricted to a single ideology.

In January 2016, we stood up the Countering Violent Extremism Task Force, to harmonize our domestic efforts, and ensure we continue to integrate public health, education, and other disciplines into our approach. In July of this year, the DHS Office of Community Partnerships announced the first grants for CVE programming, and we received more than 200 applications from 42 states and territories requesting more than $100 million.

As we partner with local communities, we are also continuing productive dialogues with tech companies about how to address terrorist activities online. Companies are taking more proactive actions against terrorist actors, including by suspending accounts associated with terrorism and enacting “zero tolerance” policies for terrorist activities on their platforms.

After years of doing this work, we are more confident than ever that through partnership, we can and will overcome this threat while upholding the values and liberties that define us.

As outlined in our plan, we will focus on the following four areas.",tsa
"The busiest travel time of the year is approaching, so in the Thanksgiving spirit of sharing, we’d like to share a cornucopia of news, links and travel tips with you so you’ll be as good as gravy when you travel.

According to Airlines for America, 27.3 million passengers will travel globally on U.S. airlines during the Thanksgiving travel period. That’s up 2.5 percent from last year. That’s 2.27 million passengers per day from Nov. 18 through Tuesday, Nov. 29. For your holiday planning, the projected busiest days are November 18 to 23 and November 26 to 28.

As we approach the busy holiday travel season, TSA is taking every measure, both seen and unseen, to protect millions of air travelers and to secure our transportation system. TSA’s goal first and foremost, is to ensure your security, while also working to improve the overall travel experience.

We’re rolling out a new tool today for TSA Pre✓® travelers. You can now view TSA Pre✓® lane schedule at the nation’s largest airports. Travelers can enter their airport, day of week and time of day they’re traveling, and the tool will return the availability of TSA Pre✓® lanes. Go ahead and try it out! When no lane is available, travelers can show their boarding passes with the TSA Pre✓® indicator to receive expedited screening in a standard lane.

This is a screenshot of open TSA Pre✓®lanes at JFK today between 3pm and 5pm. (Click to enlarge)

In a nutshell, it allows eligible travelers to receive expedited screening. In layman’s terms, it means you get through security really fast. The average wait time in TSA Pre✓® lanes is under 5 minutes! Even if a TSA Pre✓® line looks longer, they move much faster than a standard lane with more convenience. For TSA Pre✓® travelers, there is no need to remove shoes, laptops, liquids, belts and light jackets. If you haven’t already, apply now!

Today, there are more than 12 million trusted travelers, including those enrolled in TSA Pre✓®, Global Entry, NEXUS and SENTRI.  These trusted travelers have access to faster TSA Pre✓® lanes at more than 180 airports when flying with participating airlines. Before you apply, please review the various DHS trusted traveler programs to ensure you meet the eligibility requirements and determine the best program for you.

Let’s get the travel tips started by addressing the 15-pound turkey in the room. Yes, your turkey can fly. Well, turkeys can’t fly, but you can pack them in your carry-on or checked bags. If you have a live turkey, you’ll need to contact your airline about their guidelines and possible restrictions.

Just as you would take the time to prepare a delicious Thanksgiving meal, you should take the time to arrive early to the airport to allow enough time to park, get your boarding pass, check your baggage and go through the security checkpoint. We recommend arriving at the airport up to two hours before your domestic flight if you are not yet enrolled in TSA Pre✓®. Also, we recommend noting when your airline gate closes by referring to your boarding pass.

Large buckles can set off our metal detectors and your blunderbuss must be packed in checked bags according to our packing guidelines.

If you’re looking at your boarding pass and you don’t see the TSA Pre✓® indicator even though you’re an approved trusted traveler, we’re here to help! Get live assistance by tweeting @AskTSA or via Facebook Messenger. Our AskTSA team can help resolve any issues. If you prefer to call, you can reach out to our contact center.

Some travelers pack the craziest items. Make sure you’re items are allowed by using the “Can I Bring My…” tool to enter the item you want to pack. It will tell you whether you can pack it in your carry-on or checked bag. You may also refer to our prohibited items list. If you still can’t find the answer, reach out to our @AskTSA team via Twitter or Facebook Messenger and they’ll get back to you right away with an answer. You can even send them a photograph of the item in question. If you’re grabbing a bag, suitcase, briefcase, jacket or other item you haven’t used in a while, be sure to give it the onceover so you don’t accidentally take something prohibited to the checkpoint. Many people who have brought guns, ammunition, knives and other prohibited item say that they did so unknowingly. So far this year, over 2,00o firearms have been discovered in carry-on bags.

E-cigarettes and vape pens are only allowed in carry-on bags. They’re prohibited in checked bags due to their lithium battery’s propensity to catch fire. Read more information in our blog post on the subject.

The FAA has declared Samsung Note 7 devices as forbidden hazardous materials and has banned them altogether from flight. You can read more at the FAA webpage.

TSA will continue to accept driver’s licenses issued by all states through January 2018 and, then, will continue to accept licenses from all compliant states or noncompliant states with an extension.

We’re not the Heat Miser; however, we might have to unwrap gifts. If there’s something in the gift that needs to be inspected, we may have to open it. Our officers try their best not to mangle the gift wrap, but it’s not a guarantee and it also slows down the line for everybody else.

If you’re checking a bag, make your life simple by packing liquids in your checked baggage. That way, you don’t have to worry about the liquids rules. You’re allowed to take as many 3.4 ounce or smaller sized containers that will fit in one sealed, clear, quart-sized zip-top bag – and one bag per person. Make sure you take the zip-top bag out of your carry-on prior to sending it through the X-ray.

Each year, CBP officers and import specialists get to preview the latest holiday merchandise in June when CBP processes the first containers of decorations and toys for all ages at the nation’s seaports and airports.

DHS Photo by U.S. Customs and Border Protection

Within the trillions of dollars of shipments destined for retail shelves around the nation, CBP officers and import specialists are on the hunt for products that are unsafe or fake. Last year, CBP recorded more than 28,000 seizures of products that violated intellectual property rights, worth an estimated $1.3 trillion in manufacturer’s suggested retail price if the products had been genuine.

Some may view counterfeiting as a victimless crime, but it is destructive to our economy, and in some cases is hazardous to consumers. Counterfeits are often made of inferior materials, manufactured under uncontrolled and unsanitary conditions, and labeled with false information. As a result, they can threaten the health and safety of the people who buy them, or receive them as a gift.

Some concerning examples of counterfeit products we’ve seized include medication, makeup, power strip outlets, laundry detergent and toys.

This holiday season, you can protect you, your loved ones and the economy by avoiding counterfeits and purchasing the genuine product. Below are five tips that can help.

I encourage you to share these tips with your friends and family so they too can make informed decisions about the products they buy this holiday season.

"As a member of the TSA Visible Intermodal Prevention and Response team, I work in collaboration with federal, state and local transportation stakeholders to prevent and deter acts of terrorism against U.S. transportation systems. My duties take TSA beyond the airport checkpoint through a strong network of security professionals.

I along with other VIPR team members, deploy daily with law enforcement and security partners in all modes of transportation including: commercial aviation, air cargo, general aviation, mass transit, maritime, freight rail, highway infrastructure and pipeline. We also deploy during special events, such as the Super Bowl, NCAA Football Championship, and Presidential Inauguration to enhance security in the transportation domain.

Through vigilance, observance of suspicious behavior and surveillance, we work to protect airports, public conveyance/vessels and other critical infrastructure.

This past Saturday for example, six unattended bags were observed while patrolling Washington Dulles International Airport. All passengers were reunited with their bags, which were cleared by law enforcement K-9 teams. This is one of my many daily duties that help prevent dangerous items or bags from causing harm.

I take pride in being responsible for ensuring that airport employees and passengers feel safe. My overall mission is to ensure the traveling public reaches their destination safely, especially during this holiday travel season.

As a VIPR team member, working holidays and weekends is well worth it to put the traveling public mind at ease.",tsa
"The dedicated workforce at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is ensuring the just return of cultural artifacts to their countries of origin as part of the wide-ranging duties of the Department of Homeland Security.

On Thursday, ICE repatriated five illegally smuggled ancient Egyptian artifacts to the government of Egypt. The artifacts included a nesting sarcophagus, a wooden child’s sarcophagus, and the hand of a mummy dating to the 8th century BCE.

That the Egyptian people have recovered these important pieces of their history was made possible by Operation Mummy’s Curse, multi-year investigation by ICE Homeland Security Investigations (HSI).

ICE has returned more than 80 items to Egypt for repatriations since 2007. More than 7,800 artifacts have been returned to over 30 countries over the same period. These have included 19th century masterpiece paintings from France, ancient cultural relics from China, and even a set of dinosaur fossils.

DHS is in a unique position to save the historical, cultural and artistic property of nations around the world. Federal importation laws give HSI the authority to investigate crimes involving the illicit importation and distribution of stolen artifacts. Customs laws allow HSI to seize cultural property and art that are brought into the United States illegally. In addition, thanks to a partnership with the Smithsonian Museum’s Conservation Institute, ICE agents are specially trained to identify and properly store cultural artifacts – many of which are centuries old.",tsa
"By Presidential Proclamation, January recognized National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month, rallying the public to raise awareness about and end this heinous crime. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), alongside many other federal agencies, organizations, and individuals across the country worked to increase awareness throughout January.

The DHS Blue Campaign, the unified voice for DHS efforts to combat human trafficking, organized and participated in several signature Washington D.C. area-events, released new resources on our website, and launched social media initiatives to foster conversation about how we can end human trafficking in our communities.

"Earlier this month a team of U.S. Coast Guard chefs won seven Silver and four Bronze medals at the 42nd Annual Military Culinary Arts Competitive Training Event in Fort Lee, Virginia. The Coast Guard Culinary Specialists serve in approximately 370 units worldwide supporting the Coast Guard mission by preparing nutritious meals for crew members and serving in various collateral duties on board the unit. Participants competed against each other in this event, promoting growth in the culinary profession with special attention to the tenets of modern culinary ability, practicality, nutrition, workmanship, economy, presentation, creativity and concept.

The Coast Guard chefs assigned to the Executive Dining Facility (EDF) at DHS headquarters, joined alongside the U.S. Coast Guard’s culinary team to participate in the Army Mobile Kitchen Trailer event, producing a three-course meal for 50 people using field equipment powered by jet fuel. The Coast Guard team was comprised of culinary specialists from Station Little Creek in Virginia Beach; Coast Guard Cutter Shearwater in Portsmouth, Virginia; Cutter Obion in Owensboro, Kentucky, as well as Coast Guard Headquarters in Washington, D.C.

"In addition to training federal law enforcement, the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers (FLETC) also has a robust mission to provide training to our nation’s state, local and tribal law enforcement officers. FLETC trained more than 4,500 state, local, tribal, and territorial students last fiscal year.

The program was originally established by President Ronald Reagan as the National Center for State and Local Law Enforcement Training on October 1982 in response to the findings of the Attorney General's Task Force on Violent Crime.  Task Force members had serious concerns about the rising crime rate in the United States and urged that the Federal Government take a more active role in providing law enforcement training for state and local agencies.

The State, Local and Tribal Division (SLTD) is located at the FLETC headquarters in Glynco, Georgia, but exports law enforcement training on a variety of topics across the country.  Some of the most popular classes include the Active Shooter Threat Training Program, Active Shooter Threat Instructor Training Program, Basic Tactical Medical Instructor Training Program, and Tactical Medical for First Responders.

FLETC employs the life-saving training during an outdoor exercise. (Photo courtesy of FLETC/DHS)

Since the full implementation of Tactical Medical training at the FLETC, there have been numerous instances of applied training directly attributed to lives saved.  Officers receive a minimum of eight hours of training in basic tactical medical procedures and leave the training with a standardized Individual First-Aid Kit (IFAK).  The IFAK contains only items to be used for immediate life saving measures during evolving, sometimes austere environments.

Often Tactical Medical Training Students at FLETC use the skills or the IFAK within hours or days of graduation.  One student was able to apply a tourniquet to control bleeding for the victim of domestic abuse.  Another student used a chest seal to treat the victim of multiple gunshots.  One officer who’s partner had been shot, used techniques learned in class including using hemostatic agent to treat his partner and extraction techniques to secure his partner’s weapon and remove him from a second floor window.

While these success stories highlight the programs importance and applicability, it also applies to “everyday” scenarios.  A student attending a family function had a family member suffer a major laceration to his upper thigh.  The student was able to apply the tourniquet issued with his IFAK and stop the bleeding.  This situation highlights the skills taught in the Tactical Medical program and their importance in everyday life, not just law enforcement situations.

A FLETC student applies direct pressure and a tourniquet to simulated wound during a class.  (Photo courtesy of FLETC/DHS)

FLETC routinely receives feedback on how the program has impacted the everyday lives of the officers.  Officers have begun re-thinking the location of the first-aid kits in their vehicles keeping them accessible and known to other officers, carrying the lifesaving gear with them, evaluating methods to control bleeding, as well as scanning for threats when entering an area.  As a result, the Tactical Medical program is impacting the daily activities of officers across the country in ways not seen in many years and saving lives.

The advanced training programs and workshops offered are developed with the advice, assistance and support of federal, state, local, tribal, and campus law enforcement agencies and experts. Training is continuously updated to ensure accuracy and relevance to today’s issues and is certified by each state’s Peace Officer’s Standards and Training (P.O.S.T.) if and when certification is available.

State, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies can find out more on FLETC courses available to them at the FLETC.gov website at https://go.usa.gov/xXCwq",tsa
"Identity theft and online fraud are on the rise during tax season as millions of Americans now file their taxes online. In the 2016 tax season, the IRS saw an approximate 400 percent surge in phishing and malware incidents targeting tax filers.  Sophisticated cybercriminals are looking to steal your identity and fraudulently claim your tax refund, making it critical to stay extra vigilant in the coming weeks.

It is easier than you might think for criminals to claim tax returns fraudulently. In most cases all they need is your name, social security number, and date of birth. During tax season, and year-round, consumers should be very cautious about sharing personal information online. Consumers should not trust any text messages, emails, or phone calls from anyone claiming to represent the IRS and asking to share personal information.

"This March, the Department of Homeland Security celebrated its fourteenth anniversary, as well as Women’s History Month.

Long before the Department opened its doors in 2003, women were carrying out the mission to ensure a safe and secure America. In World War Two, Navy WAVES, Women Accepted for Voluntary Emergency Service, operated banks of cryptanalysis machines, also known as bombes, to decipher German code in what are now the halls of DHS headquarters.

Ida Lewis served in the U.S. Lighthouse Service, one of the Coast Guard's predecessors. In 1881, she was officially credited with saving 18 lives during her 39 years at Lime Rock Light Station in Newport, Rhode Island and was awarded the Gold Lifesaving Medal.

Women have played integral roles in countless missions as part of the Coast Guard Women’s Reserve or SPARs program, Semper Paratus – Always Ready, created in 1942. More than 10,000 women volunteered between 1942 and 1946.

Today, women from all walks of life serve in the department’s component agencies. Serving as Transportation Security Administration and U.S. Secret Service agents, Federal Emergency Management Agency coordinators, Federal Law Enforcement Training Center officers, and so much more.

In 2009, Janet Napolitano became the first woman to lead the Department of Homeland Security as Secretary. Today, Kirstjen Nielsen serves as the Department’s Chief of Staff, U.S. Coast Guard Rear Admiral Joanna Nunan as the Department’s Military Advisor, and Connie Patrick as Director of the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers.

Earlier this month, Presidential nominee Elaine Duke testified before the U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs on her experience and capability to serve the Department as Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security.

As Secretary Kelly pointed out at the start of Women’s History Month, the department continues to honor the men and women of DHS who work tirelessly to uphold the rights of women who are victims of human trafficking, domestic violence, and other crimes.

This month and every month, DHS honors the women who safeguard the American people, protect our homeland, and embody our values.

With honor and integrity, we will safeguard the American people, our homeland, and our values.",tsa
"All containerized cargo coming into seaports in the United States is scanned by radiation detection equipment.  Recently a new radiation detection system began operating at the Trans Pacific Container Service Corporation (TraPac) terminal at the Port of Los Angeles in California.  The new system automatically scans inbound cargo for nuclear and other radioactive material.

Cargo bound for rail transport is placed on conveyers by automated straddle carriers.  The conveyers then move the cargo through Radiation Portal Monitors for scanning.   This innovative approach facilitates the flow of trade while protecting the United States from nuclear threats.

The effort to develop this new system was truly collaborative.  As TraPac planned to move to an automated terminal, U.S. Customs and Border Protection needed a new method to scan ship-to-rail containers for radioactive material.  After TraPac approached DHS with this new scanning concept, DHS worked with the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) to extensively test, evaluate, and approve the systems for live rail operations.

Approximately 2 million containers are processed through the TraPac terminal every year.  This new solution offers a more efficient approach to preventing illicit nuclear and other radioactive materials from entering the U.S.

Automated straddle carriers place intermodal cargo containers on conveyors for scanning by Radiation Portal Monitors for radioactive material before the cargo leaves the TraPac terminal.",tsa
"On April 5th, the Science and Technology Directorate officially opened a new Test & Evaluation Laboratory building at the Transportation Security Laboratory (TSL). Located at the William J. Hughes FAA Technical Center in Egg Harbor Township, N.J., the new building expands TSL’s reinforced laboratory space for conducting tests of explosives detection systems.

“At TSL, their call to action is to address the ‘what could happen.’ And to answer this call, they conduct special studies to ensure we identify and correct vulnerabilities before they play out in a real-world event” said S&T Under Secretary (acting) Dr. Robert Griffin at today’s ribbon-cutting event. “While you may not hear it on the news, the work on this 12-acre secure campus is helping us thwart the terror threats that crop up around the world.”

One of TSL’s primary responsibilities is to provide independent test and evaluation of commercial explosives detection equipment and certify them for use in checked luggage and checkpoint environments. The facility consists of specialized explosive storage and handling areas and a multi-laboratory infrastructure designed to test and evaluate technology for explosives and contraband detection and blast mitigation.

“Today we renew with vigor a lasting commitment to aviation security that we made 25 years ago to make the skies safer and the world more secure,” said TSL Director Christopher Smith.  Established in 1992 as part of the federal response to the Pan Am 103 Lockerbie bombing of 1988, TSL is internationally recognized for its unique ability to advance detection technology from conception to deployment, through applied research, test and evaluation, assessment, certification and qualification testing. “Back then we constructed a laboratory to develop and test equipment to detect bombs hidden in checked luggage. Today we are expanding those capabilities to address threats that are constantly increasing in complexity and variety,” Smith said.

With this new building, the staff of scientists and engineers at TSL are able to conduct more performance tests with its unique variety of commercial, military and non-traditional explosives. The results of these tests provide critical information to the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), other DHS components, various government agencies, and many international government partner agencies. TSL is the only laboratory authorized to provide certification and qualification testing of explosives detection systems for the TSA.

Every traveler boarding a plane from any airport in the United States, including his or her carry-on and checked baggage, is screened by explosive detection systems that were tested and certified at this facility.

"Last week, the Department of Homeland Security’s Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) joined with partners at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) to launch the Plutonium Processing Signatures Discovery capability.  The new capability, the result of a four-year effort, represents a significant technological advancement in nuclear forensics that will improve our ability to trace the origins of plutonium.  Nuclear forensics involves determining where illicit or smuggled radioactive material came from.  In the event of a nuclear weapon detonation, knowing where radioactive material came from can help investigators determine who’s responsible.

There are different ways to process plutonium.  These varied processes can produce slightly different characteristics in plutonium, such as the color and density.  These unique characteristics found in nuclear materials are referred to as “nuclear forensics signatures.”  This new capability will significantly improve our ability to trace the origins of plutonium, because it allows us to replicate individual nations’ processes.  This not only helps us identify where the radioactive material came from, but also allows us to predict forensic signatures of plutonium from a given process without having actual samples of those materials.

The new Plutonium Processing Signatures Discovery capability, along with other nuclear forensics clues and law enforcement and intelligence information, will help in identifying the origin of interdicted nuclear materials and the perpetrators responsible.

As Dr. Steven Ashby, Director of PNNL, said, “The development of the Plutonium Processing Signatures Discovery capability is four years in the making and the result of a great partnership and close collaboration between PNNL, DNDO, and the nuclear forensics community.”",tsa

Secretary Kelly and Deputy Secretary Duke are participating in Police Week events to thank law enforcement officers and their families for their important role in keeping our nation safe.

“Tonight, we remember our fallen brothers and sisters,” Secretary Kelly said at the Police Week Candlelight Vigil. “We pay tribute to their strength, honor their courage, and comfort those they left behind. Each name is an officer who went to work one day, and never came home. Each one is a hero. But make no mistake—they are not heroes because of how they died. They are heroes because they lived lives of bravery, honor, and compassion.

“Behind each name engraved in marble are the loved ones left behind. Their watch has not ended. Their grief endures. They visit the memorial and leave tokens of remembrance under the watchful eye of the bronze lions.

“To those of you who made the pilgrimage here tonight—and for those of you who are watching at home—thank you. On behalf of our nation’s leadership, on behalf of the law enforcement family, and on behalf of the citizens these officers served, thank you. Your fathers, mothers, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters, colleagues, and friends are the best of our humanity. We will keep them in our hearts forever.”

"Flying within the U.S. this summer? You’re not alone. Experts estimate that more people are taking to the skies this year than ever before, with 40 million Americans traveling on Memorial Day weekend alone. Want to get through security as fast as possible, while still being safe? Check out these tips for domestic travel from your friends at TSA.

Why start your vacation stressed out? Give yourself plenty of time to park, check-in, and go through security. We recommend arriving two hours before your flight. If the lines are short, hey, more time for last minute gift shopping or to meet your fellow travelers.

More people flying = more carry-on bags = more time needed to get through the screening checkpoint.

It takes time for TSA officers to make sure a jam-packed, cluttered, overstuffed bag is safe. And the more time is takes to screen your bag, the longer you—and everyone behind you—are stuck in line.

TSA’s 3-1-1 is shorthand for the liquids rule. Basically, limit your liquids, gels and pastes to no more than 3.4 ounces, or 100 milliliters, in 1 bag that’s no bigger than 1 quart. That’s bigger than a sandwich bag, but smaller than a huge freezer bag. Sure, they could call it 1 bag-1 quart-3.4 ounces, but that’s much less catchy.

That sounds really obvious, right? Well, someone’s not getting the message—TSA found 3,391 guns in carry-on bags last year. That averages out to more than 9 guns every day of 2016. Think of The Godfather—Leave the gun, take the cannoli.

Have appropriate ID and your boarding pass out and ready to go. Standard screening requires that you take your laptop out of your bag. Follow the 3-1-1 liquids rule. Wearing shoes you can get off and on easily also helps keep everyone behind you in line happy.

TSA Pre✓® lets you leave your shoes, belt, and light jacket on while you go through security. You can also leave your laptop and your liquids in your bag. It costs $85 for five years—that’s only $17 a year. And isn’t your time worth $17 a year? Learn more at TSA.gov.

"The United States and Canada recently held the first joint nuclear forensics exercise between the two countries, in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.  The exercise simulated a nuclear detonation, allowing experts from both countries to improve operational readiness to respond to radiological or nuclear attacks.  The advancement of international cooperation in nuclear forensics will help improve the ability of the U.S. and its allies to determine the source of a detonated device.

During the exercise, the United States Government’s National Technical Nuclear Forensics Ground Collection Task Force deployed to Canada at their request and practiced collecting samples of simulated nuclear debris near the site of the hypothetical detonation. This highly specialized task force is equipped to conduct collections in radioactive environments and includes scientists and experts in the fields of nuclear forensics, evidence collection, hazardous material, contamination control, and health physics. In the case of an actual event, these samples would be transported to designated U.S. laboratories for forensic analysis.  Nuclear forensics conclusions inform intelligence and law enforcement operations in determining those responsible for the attack.  These conclusions also help prevent further attacks from occurring.

This exercise was the culmination of an 18-month effort between the governments of the United States and Canada. Particularly, the close collaboration between DHS’s Domestic Nuclear Detection Office and the Canadian Department of National Defence, Canadian Joint Operations Command, Joint Task Force Atlantic, and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police helped make this exercise a success. DHS also worked closely with the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration, the Department of State, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation throughout the planning and conduct of the exercise.

It is U.S. policy to hold fully accountable any state or non-state actor that willfully supports, enables, or engages in hostile nuclear activities that target or threaten the United States or our allies and partners.  Nuclear forensics enables this policy by providing the scientific basis for identifying perpetrators and sponsors of nuclear terrorism.

The DHS Domestic Nuclear Detection Office serves as the national integrator for the United States’ nuclear forensics capabilities and, along with its partners, helps ensure that these capabilities are ready to respond to an event on the homeland or anywhere around the world.",tsa

This interdiction is the largest maritime seizure in the Atlantic since 1999 and was the result of ongoing, multi-agency and international law enforcement efforts led by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Saint Croix and assisted by DEA Barbados Office and the Caribbean Corridor Strike Force in support of Operation Unified Resolve, Operation Caribbean Guard, and international cooperation, including the British National Crime Agency (NCA).

During the night of Feb. 16, the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Joseph Napier detected and interdicted a suspicious fishing vessel in international waters north of Paramaribo, Suriname, in the Atlantic Ocean.

The Joseph Napier crew interdicted the 70-foot fishing vessel, Lady Michelle, detained the four suspected smugglers and seized numerous bales of contraband, which tested positive for cocaine.  Following the interdiction, a Trinidad and Tobago SPA class Coast Guard cutter based out of Staubles Bay, Trinidad, which was on a joint patrol with the Joseph Napier, provided safety and escort assistance on scene.

The crew of the Joseph Napier seized the contraband, apprehended the detainees, and towed the fishing vessel until relieved by the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Vigilant. Vigilant then towed the fishing vessel to the island of St. Vincent, where the Lady Michelle is registered, and transferred the seized vessel to the custody of the St. Vincent Coast Guard.

The contraband was transported to Puerto Rico, where it was disembarked and placed in the custody of DEA, Caribbean Division special agents for processing and disposition.

""The excellent coordination between the U.S. Coast Guard, and international law enforcement agencies prevented this major drug shipment from reaching our communities,"" said Capt. Robert W. Warren, Coast Guard Sector San Juan commander.  ""We appreciate our continued partnerships with the Trinidad and Tobago Coast Guard and St. Vincent Coast Guard. Our collective efforts are working to secure our region’s maritime borders and protect our citizens from this threat.""

“As the cocaine flow from South America continues to increase, law enforcement partners in the Eastern Caribbean Region have to increase our collaborative efforts in order to effectively respond to the threat,” said James Doby, Assistant Special Agent in Charge (ASAC) DEA Caribbean Division. “Such collaborative efforts are currently underway in the Caribbean Corridor Strike Force, where law enforcement partners are collocated every day.”

The Coast Guard’s efforts under Operation Unified Resolve contribute to the interagency results being achieved locally each and every day under Operation Caribbean Guard, which coordinates efforts between the Coast Guard, DHS and the Commonwealth and Territorial law enforcement partners, who are working diligently to deter, detect and disrupt illicit maritime trafficking to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

"Each March, we celebrate Women’s History Month—a time to recognize the extraordinary achievements of American women. This year’s theme: “Honoring Trailblazing Women in Labor and Business” pays homage to the courage and perseverance of women who challenged the antiquated perceptions of their contributions and value in the paid labor force, defying societal norms and improving working conditions and wages for all women.

In keeping with this year’s theme, we honor the extraordinary women of DHS leading the charge of safeguarding our homeland and our values. Here at DHS, women in civil service are leading in remarkable ways—shaping public policies, securing and managing our borders, preventing and obstructing terrorist and public safety threats, and protecting our nation’s cyber networks and critical infrastructure. Every day, women of DHS are inspiring future leaders in the homeland security enterprise.

We also honor the men and women of DHS who work tirelessly to uphold the rights of women who are victims of human trafficking, domestic violence, and other crimes. Through the work of the Blue Campaign, DHS’s unified voice to combat human trafficking; the DHS Council on Combating Violence Against Women; FLETC’s international Women In Law Enforcement Leadership Training Program; and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services’ immigration relief for victims of crimes, to name just a few, DHS provides resources for the safety and empowerment of women throughout the United States

I am very proud to work with such a remarkable group of women who contribute to the mission of DHS, and who continue to overcome barriers each and every day. Please join me as we honor women who blazed trails in labor, business, and government, and who are creating pathways for future generations.

With honor and integrity, we will safeguard the American people, our homeland, and our values.",tsa
"In October 2014, a 27-year veteran of the U.S. Secret Service (USSS) accepted an appointment to serve as the Acting Director of the U.S. Secret Service. By February 18, 2015, the President of the United States had asked him to settle in for the long haul.

Director Clancy’s service began in May 1984 in the Philadelphia field office before he was transferred to the Presidential Protective Division where he served for eight years. From the field, to the White House, to USSS Headquarters, to Congress as a detailee to the Commerce, Justice and State Senate Appropriations Subcommittee, and to internal affairs, Director Clancy dedicated himself to a life of service.

The appointment to the Acting role as the Director of the Secret Service brought Director Clancy out of retirement. Director Clancy emerged as a true leader in the agency and Department’s moment of need, and demonstrated once again that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s foundation rests on the backs of the men and women, the true public servants, who carry out its mission.

Secretary Kelly honored Director Clancy’s 29 years of dedicated service with the Department of Homeland Security Distinguished Public Service Medal.

Director Clancy will always champion the good work done by the men and women of the Secret Service in service to this country, and presented Secretary Kelly with a gift welcoming him into the fold of the USSS family. Ahead of an interagency hockey game against the Federal Bureau of Investigations, Secretary Kelly received a hockey jersey so that he may proudly represent the Secret Service colors.

Thank you, Director Clancy, for your years of unwavering commitment and honorable service to the Department.",tsa
"Earlier this week, Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly addressed the International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF) Legislative Conference in Washington, D.C. to discuss the Department’s priorities.

The partnership between the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the IAFF is critical. Together, we work to support our strong, resilient communities.

Secretary Kelly stressed the importance of supporting the Nation’s firefighters who protect their hometowns. Secretary Kelly specifically cited the need for emotional support and highlighted the grand opening of the IAFF’s Center of Excellence for Behavioral Health Treatment and Recovery in Upper Marlboro, Maryland outside of Washington, D.C. This inpatient facility is staffed with professionals who are highly trained to understand the unique challenges and stressor of firefighters’ day-to-day lives.

During his remarks, Secretary Kelly also highlighted the importance of this partnership between local firefighters and the Department of Homeland Security. The security of our Nation, Secretary Kelly said, is too large and complex for just one Department to handle alone. Therefore, we continue to rely on the expertise and input from state, local, tribal, and territorial partners in a whole community approach.

Secretary Kelly thanked the IAFF members for their longstanding commitment over the past 99 years to the support of firefighters and keeping citizens safe.",tsa

"Since the devastating terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, law enforcement in this nation has changed. The Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers (FLETC) quickly understood this new reality meant law enforcement training had to change, too. We recall that on September 12, Americans woke up with a renewed sense of patriotism born out of the necessity to ensure such tragedy never happened again. The newest building on our FLETC campus is named after September 12, 2001, and symbolizes that spirit as we train those who protect our homeland.

Last week, we opened Building 9/12, a state-of-the-art training facility that building significantly expands the current operations and capabilities of our headquarters in Glynco, Georgia to provide exemplary training to our law enforcement in the face of a rapidly changing threat environment. The building is also as a symbolic gesture representing our country’s evolution immediately following September 11, including the creation of the Department of Homeland Security, and honoring those who choose to become law enforcement officers and agents in the service of our nation.

More than 150 FLETC employees, partner organizations, community leaders, and congressional staffers joined me as we recognized the significant effort that went into the design and construction of this building.

This new building also expands FLETC’s capacity and flexibility to host special events, graduations, and summits, while also offering opportunities for cost savings. As a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Silver construction project, this building is environmentally efficient, and even features a “living pond” that collects, filters, and holds 100 percent of the facility’s own storm water.

Building 9/12 pays a special and unique tribute to the nobility of the law enforcement profession through four memorial and historical displays, including FLETC’s 9/11 Memorial; the FLETC Graduates Memorial; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives’ Canine Memorial; and the Glynco Historical Display, which tells the story of Glynco’s evolution from an operational naval air station during World War II to the headquarters for our nation’s largest law enforcement training facility.

Today, Building 9/12 stands proudly on the grounds of the FLETC as a living testament to the Department’s leadership and evolution. Together as one DHS, we adapt to and proactively address emerging threats, we support our partners’ needs, and we advance the nation’s homeland security goals.",tsa
"For most Americans, the holidays are a time for traveling to see loved ones near and far. Whether you are traveling by plane, train, or automobile, chances are you will have at least one connected device in tow. Mobile devices have become an almost essential tool for us all as we travel.

"Traveling for the holidays? Just as with Thanksgiving, we’d like to offer you some relevant news and tips to help get you to your destination a little easier.

You can now view TSA Pre✓® lane schedule at the nation’s largest airports. Travelers can enter their airport, day of week and time of day they’re traveling, and the tool will return the availability of TSA Pre✓® lanes. Go ahead and try it out! When no lane is available, travelers can show their boarding passes with the TSA Pre✓® indicator to receive expedited screening in a standard lane.

In a nutshell, it allows eligible travelers to receive expedited screening. In layman’s terms, it means you get through security really fast. The average wait time in TSA Pre✓® lanes is under 5 minutes! Even if a TSA Pre✓® line looks longer, they move much faster than a standard lane with more convenience. For TSA Pre✓® travelers, there is no need to remove shoes, laptops, liquids, belts and light jackets. If you haven’t already, apply now! Today, there are more than 12 million trusted travelers, including those enrolled in TSA Pre✓®, Global Entry, NEXUS and SENTRI.  These trusted travelers have access to faster TSA Pre✓® lanes at more than 180 airports when flying with participating airlines. Before you apply, please review the various DHS trusted traveler programs to ensure you meet the eligibility requirements and determine the best program for you.

We’re not the Heat Miser; however, we might have to unwrap gifts. If there’s something in the gift that needs to be inspected, we may have to open it. Our officers try their best not to mangle the gift wrap, but it’s not a guarantee and it also slows down the line for everybody else.

TSA now allows small snow globes in carry-on luggage when packed in a passenger's plastic 3.4 oz bag. Snow globes that appear to contain less than 3.4 ounces (approximately tennis-ball size) will be permitted if the entire snow globe, including the base, is able to fit in the same one clear, plastic, quart-sized, re-sealable bag as a passenger’s other liquids.

Not the kind you eat with a delicious cheese-ball, but the kind that “cracks” when you pull it apart. They’re a part of a lot of people’s Christmas traditions, but they’re prohibited on aircraft.

Just as you would take the time to prepare a delicious Thanksgiving meal, you should take the time to arrive early to the airport to allow enough time to park, get your boarding pass, check your baggage and go through the security checkpoint. We recommend arriving at the airport up to two hours before your domestic flight if you are not yet enrolled in TSA Pre✓®. Also, we recommend noting when your airline gate closes by referring to your boarding pass.

"Entry Point North Ireland (EPNI) officially opened a new Air Traffic Control Tower Simulator at its Dublin Air Traffic Control Centre (ATCC) at Dublin Airport today (Tuesday, 27 June 2017). The new high-technology simulator, the second such installation in Europe, will be the platform in respect to all future aerodrome training for Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) Dublin-based air traffic control officers.

This instalation enhances the expansion of EPNI operations in Ireland, whose core training centre is in Shannon Co Clare. The expansion will serve to manage the increased training demand from Dublin ATC operations to handle the ever increasing airport traffic. It will also provide an upgraded state-of-the-art tower simulator to support the most intricate extra training requirements and procedure evalution for the proposed new runway for 2020.

The new simulator consists of twenty-two 65"" UHD displays that are driven by a similar total of high performance image generators incorporating top quality graphics cards. The display system gives a 270° horizontal field of view, and has a diameter of 8 metres with a height of 1.5 metres. It is also possible to show a 360° field of view on the physical 270° screen. The system provides an ultra-sharp picture, as 47,500 x 3,840 pixels are projected onto a 19 x 1.5 metre screen. The setup provides room for five tower controller positions and up to eight pilot positions. Some of these positions are also suitable to use for approach or area control training.

Speaking at the launch, Entry Point North CEO Anne Kathrine Jensen said: “Today marks another great milestone for Entry Point North Ireland; we are a world-leading Air Traffic Management training provider and this technologically advanced tower simulator in Dublin positions us well in the years ahead.”

IAA CEO Eamonn Brennan added: “This innovative system is supporting our growing needs at Dublin Airport. Traffic at Dublin Airport has grown significantly over the past few years and work is underway to develop a new parallel runway by 2020. As a shareholder in Entry Point North we are delighted to see this state-of-the-art infrastructure in Dublin.”

Outlining the benefits the new tower simulator will deliver, EPNI’s managing director Austin Hallahan said: “It can simulate the planned new runway and required procedures to ensure a safe efficient operation and can be configured vertically or horizontally using a single or multiple visual channels to accomplish the desired field-of-view. The simulation creates a realistic, immersive environment for training including a wide variety of ancillary equipment commonly found in control towers.

“It’s a significant addition to our ATC training capability. EPNI has delivered over 3,000 student weeks of cost-efficient ATC training to over 350 air traffic control officers since its inception three years ago serving all training requirements of the following Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) business units: Shannon Enroute, Dublin Terminal, Shannon and Cork Business Units and the North Atlantic Communications Centre.",air-traffic
"The mission preparation system OPERA provides pilots with all the necessary information for flight simulation training and flight missions by combining high-performance software with an intuitive interface.

In search of an innovative technological solution that would be precise, comprehensive and tailored to its needs, Dassault Aviation has chosen to work with Altran and Luciad in order to design its Mission Preparation System, known as OPERA, for its RAFALE and Mirage 2000 fighter jets.

The relevance and accuracy of geographic information is a key component for mission success. OPERA is a user-friendly system, dedicated to the preparation of training simulations and combat missions. The system first makes it possible to prepare a mission by supplying pilots with all necessary information (aerial photographs, satellite coverage of terrain, aeronautical charts, 2D/3D topography, targets, ally and enemy troops, along with other tactical and geographic data). OPERA then allows pilots to rehearse the mission in order to validate tactical choices. Once this stage is completed, the system converts the data to a dedicated format for uploading to mission calculators. In addition to its outstanding software performance, the system supplied by Altran and Luciad provides a functional and intuitive user interface.

“The visual geospatial analysis tool, ‘LuciadLightspeed’ takes into account every one of our data formats Furthermore, this product offers 2D, 3D and 4D capabilities. Its performance, precision, and handling of data in real time are features that Dassault Aviation found compelling. Its intuitive user interface made it possible to quickly deploy it among our development teams with the expertise of Altran’s aeronautics consultants,” explained Salvador Lopez, Head of OPERA program at Dassault Aviation.

“The complementarity between Altran and Luciad was a determining factor in this project. By offering Dassault Aviation a product with great added value that was tailored to their environment and needs, we were able to stand out together,” added Fabrice Mariaud, Director of Program Management & Innovation, Altran France.

“We are now partners with Altran. Together, we are able to tackle our client’s most crucial projects, which require both a tool at the cutting-edge of technology that is tailored to their needs, while simultaneously managing its integration and adaptation within their existing software ecosystem,” concluded Jérôme Lutz, Director of Luciad France.",air-traffic

"After two days of lively and thought-provoking debates, the joint ECAC-EU dialogue with the air transport industry resumed today with proposals to promote investment and create suitable conditions to finance the future of European aviation.

 

 Hosted by the Italian Civil Aviation Authority Ente Nazionale per l'Aviazione Civile, over 150 senior leaders from airlines, airports, air navigation service providers, manufacturers, industry organisations and regulators debated on solutions to promote investment in aviation, overcome its specific constraints and reap the social-economic growth potential of this critical sector.

 

 ECAC President Ingrid Cherfils and European Commission Director General for Mobility and Transport Henrik Hololei opened the conference, while ICAO Secretary General Fang Liu delivered the keynote address. Italian Minister of Transport Graziano Delrio emphasised the topical and pressing nature of the investment issue in European aviation.

 

 With the objective of sustaining and attracting further investment in European aviation, the conference concluded that:

- The need for private investment is strong in Europe in order to support efficiency and growth in  a context of capacity constraints on the ground and in the air;

- In all investment decisions, all the members of the aviation value chain should focus on the customer as ultimately they must bring value in terms of service provided to passengers at the adequate price;

- Innovation plays a critical role in the evolution of aviation and calls for an intensified coordinated approach between stakeholders, in particular airlines, airports, ANSPs and regulators;

- Legal certainty and stability are fundamental for investors. Regulators have the responsabilty  to provide an adequate framework for further and sustainable financing of aviation development.

Ingrid Cherfils, ECAC President, highlighted ""Investing is a pre-requisite for further development of the aviation sector and to ensure its short- and long-term sustainability. How to make the sector more attractive for investors, how to develop innovative solutions to maximise the 'return on investment' and secure long-term financing programmes are the challenges we, as regulators, policy-makers and industry representatives, need to address together.""

 

 Henrik Hololei, Director-General, DG MOVE, European Commission, emphasised ""Aviation is about connectivity, openness and competition. We must maintain open markets and at the same time be defending European interests. The increasing demand for air travel is bringing up new issues and is putting up a real challenge for the future. We need to make these investments now in order to be prepared for the future. European regulation should support this.""

 

 Fang Liu, Secretary General, ICAO, said""Although aviation's socio-economic benefits are widely recognised, this has rarely translated into levels of investment necessary to optimise them. It is important for us to acknowledge in this regard that new forces are re-shaping the global investment landscape, including the economic and financial crisis, the emergence of new major outward investors, and recent indications that investment protectionism pressures may be on the rise. ICAO encourages States to take pragmatic measures to build a transparent, stable and predictable investment climate to support aviation development. These priorities apply to private investments, business reform and private finance initiatives, public-private partnerships or incentive schemes.""",air-traffic

"Airways New Zealand will continue to deliver air traffic control services to Niue, Samoa, the Cook Islands, and the Kingdom of Tonga after the contract was re-signed in Christchurch today, Transport Minister Simon Bridges says.



Airways New Zealand will continue to deliver air traffic control services to Niue, Samoa, the Cook Islands, and the Kingdom of Tonga after the contract was re-signed in Christchurch today, Transport Minister Simon Bridges says.

“The Pacific Upper Airspace agreement we have with these four countries is a significant part of Airways New Zealand's involvement with the Pacific region, Airways also provides all New Zealand’s air navigation services,” Mr Bridges says.

“Airways is globally renowned and respected for leading innovation and development in the aviation sector, and has provided air traffic control services under the Upper Airspace agreement for the past fifteen years.

“This renewal – for a further five years – continues to strengthen New Zealand’s relationship with these Pacific nations.

“This agreement is also significant for the many thousands of travellers who head to Pacific holiday destinations each year, and for our vibrant and growing Pacifica community in New Zealand.

“The agreement will continue to provide the same high level of safety across the Pacific as we have in New Zealand’s airspace. There are around 11,500 flights per year in our region, and this is only set to increase. Air traffic in the Asia-Pacific region is set to grow to around half of the world’s air travel within 20 years, so having a high level of safety in place is key,” Mr Bridges says.

This agreement complements the work of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) in the Pacific region, and in particular the recent Pacific Aeronautical Charting and Procedures (PACP) programme. The programme is implementing satellite-based approach procedures at 38 aerodromes across the Pacific to improve the ability of aircraft to land safely, especially in poor weather.",air-traffic
"STRESS*, a SESAR-funded project, is examining the stress factors and impact on performance of controllers when using new technologies to manage increasing volumes of air traffic. The results of the project will provide important guidance on how to best design technologies that are compatible with human capabilities and limitations, ensuring the right balance between humans and automation in the future air traffic management system.

Air traffic control is becoming increasingly automated. This means that technologies are expected to autonomously (or partially) manage tasks that are currently carried out by human operators and/or to support humans in their decision making. This new scenario will inherently change the role of the technology, its interactions with the operators and the capability of the operators to judge the quality of the information provided. This will also imply the need to assess and revise the skills required to perform tasks – as well as of how tasks, roles and responsibilities are allocated among the operators (both in the front-end and in the back-end) and between operators and machines.

Funded by the SESAR Joint Undertaking within the framework of the EU’s Horizon 2020 programme, the STRESS project aims to better understand the stress that controllers face and how interaction with new technologies may impact their performance. The ultimate goal is to support the design of technologies which will be used by controllers to manage the future air traffic scenario.

The project, which started in June 2016 and will finish in June 2018, is coordinated by Deep Blue, an Italian research and consultancy specialised in human factors, safety, validation and scientific dissemination and brings together several other European partners: Eurocontrol’s safety unit; Sapienza University of Rome, providing expertise in the measurement and analysis of neurophysiological signals and definition of indexes of human mental states and cognitive performance; the Ecole Nationale de l’Aviation Civile (ENAC), the French National School for Civil Aviation, providing first quality access to ATM experts and a long-standing expertise in innovative interaction technology; and Anadolu University, whose faculty of Aeronautics and Astronautics state-of-the-art simulation environments.

Between 6 and 9 June, project partners conducted a series of validations on stress and attention in air traffic control at Anadolu University. The objective of the study was to validate neurophysiological indices developed by the project that monitor the mental states of controllers in real-time while performing conventional air traffic control tasks. In particular, the study investigated two of the most impacted human factors in the framework of the paradigm shift to higher automation levels expected for the future: the stress level and the type and level of attentional focus.

A total of 16 air traffic control students took part in the validation activities, and were asked to manage a realistic operational scenario developed to induce different levels of attention and stress. The users’ neurophysiological signals were recorded continuously, and the data collected then compared with behavioural and performance data (looking at how controllers handled the traffic) and subjective data (feedback from experimental subjects and external experts) to verify that the indices are capable of assessing attention and stress.

The data gathered will now be analysed over the coming months to validate the project hypothesis. In the next phase, STRESS will use the validated indices to assess the air traffic controllers’ performance in high automation scenarios. The outcome will be the main input for the preparation of guidelines for future ATC systems design, with a focus on automation.",air-traffic

"NTT DATA Corporation (hereinafter NTT DATA) announces the launch of the “airpalette® UTM” software package in October 2017. This software package consists of an “FOS” (Flight Operation System) drone operation control function for businesses that use drones and a “UTM core” (UAS Traffic Management core) unmanned aircraft traffic management function for airspace managers.

The FOS function enables simultaneous remote operation of multiple drones, which will help improve the efficiency of work activities using drones, such as infrastructure inspections and disaster prevention activities. The UTM core function centralizes the management of position information of multiple drones operating in a certain airspace, and it will contribute to airspace safety by allowing quick transmission of alerts for dangerous situations to drone operators.

NTT DATA has high anticipation for the growth of drone usage and will continue to develop and provide a variety of services to help realize safe and secure drone operations in Japan and overseas.

Recent technological advances of improved drone control stability, reduced drone prices, and deregulation of drones usage around the world has made it relatively easy to utilize drones for various purposes. Due to these trends, the types of services that utilize drones have been rapidly increasing in recent years and demand for drones is increasing, especially for performing dangerous or time-consuming tasks remotely. To efficiently use drones for businesses in such applications, the need for systems to easily create flight plans and make simultaneous operation of multiple drones possible are on a rise. Meanwhile, the widespread use of drones is causing growing concern. When multiple business operators operate their drones at the same time in the same airspace, there are risks of drone to drone crashes and collision with manned aircrafts if drones enter a restricted airspace such as near airport or heliport. To resolve those issues, NTT DATA developed the airpalette UTM software package for safe and efficient operation of multiple drones based on its expertise accumulated for over more than 40 years of experience in providing IT services to customers in the field of manned aircraft traffic control and management. NTT DATA will launch the airpalette UTM starting in October 2017.

The airpalette UTM software package consists of two functions for efficient and safe drone operations. One is the FOS function for businesses (drone operators) that use drones in their business activities and drone operation service providers. The other is the UTM core function for airspace managers who manage multiple drones in flight. The FOS function enables simultaneous remote operation*1 of multiple drones. It helps improve the efficiency of work activities using drones, such as infrastructure inspections and disaster prevention activities. The UTM core function centralizes the management of drone position information operating in a certain airspace, allowing to detect possibilities of mid-air collisions and entry into a restricted airspace, and to transmit the information quickly to the drone operator, thus ensuring airspace safety. Although there are various purpose-specific drones that are being manufactured and sold currently, the airpalette UTM software package is able to offer high versatility for use with various types of drones. The FOS function will be available to drone operators, while the UTM core function will be provided to airspace managers.",air-traffic
"NAV CANADA today unveiled a rate revision proposal that would decrease rates by an average of 3.9 per cent from existing base rates. This effectively continues a temporary rate reduction that was implemented last year. Rates will be further reduced by an across the board one-time refund totalling approximately $60 million.

The strong traffic results in the current fiscal year (2017) and forecasts for fiscal 2018 have enabled the Company to propose these changes, the second year in a row that base rates will have been reduced.

The changes being proposed contain three elements, each designed to accomplish the following different objectives:

The reduced base rate and the temporary reduction would both become effective on September 1, 2017; the beginning of the Company’s fiscal year. For general aviation charges (Annual, Quarterly and Daily - Major Airport charges), the reduction would be implemented on March 1, 2018 consistent with the revision cycle for these charges.

The lower base rates would come into effect just as the 3.9 per cent temporary rate reduction, which is currently in place, is set to expire. In 2016, NAV CANADA implemented that one-year rate reduction in effect from September 1, 2016 to August 31, 2017.

While the proposed rate changes vary by service charge, on average our customers will pay about the same rates in fiscal 2018 as they did in fiscal 2017. “This is good news for our customers,” said Neil Wilson, President and CEO.  “Service charges were set to rise on September 1 when an existing temporary one-year rate reduction expired, which would have increased costs for customers. Not only does this rate proposal supersede that increase, it also returns $60 million to our customers.”

Under the charging principles of the Civil Air Navigation Services Commercialization Act, NAV CANADA must ensure that its service charges are not set at a level that, based on reasonable and prudent projections, would generate revenues exceeding the Corporation’s current and future financial requirements for providing civil air navigation services.

“Traffic growth over the past year has been higher than expected, considering the actual GDP growth rates of major world economies,” said Neil Wilson, President and CEO. “This growth has been driven primarily through the expansion of low cost carrier operations, particularly on the North Atlantic. We are forecasting that traffic growth will remain fairly strong through fiscal 2018, putting us in a position to deliver savings to customers while increasing our planned investments in people, technology and facilities.”

These proposals are subject to the mandatory notice and consultation period required by legislation. Input received during the consultation period will then be reviewed by the Company’s Board of Directors.

"The International Air Transport Association (IATA) revised its 2017 industry profitability outlook upwards. Airlines are expected to report a $31.4 billion profit (up from the previously forecast $29.8 billion) on revenues of $743 billion (up from the previously forecast $736 billion).

“This will be another solid year of performance for the airline industry. Demand for both the cargo and passenger business is stronger than expected. While revenues are increasing, earnings are being squeezed by rising fuel, labor and maintenance expenses. Airlines are still well in the black and delivering earnings above their cost of capital. But, compared to last year, there is a dip in profitability,” said Alexandre de Juniac, IATA’s Director General and CEO.

In 2017 airlines are expected to retain a net profit of $7.69 per passenger. That is down from $9.13 in 2016 and $10.08 in 2015. The average net profit margin stands at 4.2% (down from 4.9% in 2016).

“Airlines are defining a new epoch in industry profitability. For a third year in a row we expect returns that are above the cost of capital. But, with earnings of $7.69 per passenger, there is not much buffer. That’s why airlines must remain vigilant against any cost increases, including from taxes, labor and infrastructure,” said de Juniac.

While overall industry performance is strong, major regional variations remain. About half the industry profits are being generated in North America ($15.4 billion). Carriers in Europe and Asia-Pacific will each add a $7.4 billion profit to the industry total. Latin America and Middle East carriers are expected to earn $800 million and $400 million respectively. Airlines in Africa are expected to post a $100 million loss.

Strong Demand Environment: The demand environment has been much stronger than anticipated. Expectations for GDP growth in 2017 stand at 2.9%. If realized this will be the strongest global economic performance since 2011.

What is most important for the industry financial performance is that this surge in expected demand takes traffic growth ahead of planned capacity growth. As a result, the average passenger load factor is expected to reach 80.6% (slightly ahead of the 80.3% achieved in 2016), helping to boost unit revenues.

Air cargo typically grows strongly at the start of an economic upturn, as firms turn to rapid air transport to restock inventories – which is what we are seeing today. There are also retail trends, such as the switch to e-commerce and in pharmaceuticals – that are supporting air cargo growth.

Cost increases for fuel, labor and maintenance accelerated in the first quarter. Overall industry expenses are expected to rise to $687 billion, a $44 billion increase on 2016. Industry revenues are expected to increase to $743 billion, $38 billion more than 2016.

Yields are still expected to be down on 2016 levels, but there are signs of stabilization in the first half of the year with a slight improvement anticipated towards year-end, driven by better capacity utilization and the imperative to respond to the rise of unit costs.

North American airlines are the powerhouse of industry profitability, generating about half of the collective global profit. This is owing to the restructuring of the industry, a relatively strong economy and a resilient US dollar. The region’s carriers also face challenges. Very limited fuel hedging delivered quick benefits when fuel prices fell. Conversely, there is less of a buffer as fuel prices rise. A tight labor market is adding more pressure to profits by pushing up wages. Nonetheless, profitability remains at historically high levels, even if slightly down on 2016.

Cargo is playing a large role in the strength of the region’s carriers, which collectively account for about 40% of air cargo shipments. Cargo revenues are rising for the first time in several years and this trend should be boosted by the restocking of retailers and industry in the initial stages of the economic upturn. China continues to reorient its economy away from exports and toward domestic demand. The wider Asia region is still the key source of manufactured components and finished goods which is showing   strong demand at the start of the cyclical economic upturn seen in recent quarters.

Terror incidents in 2016 have dented European demand. Performance over the first months of the year pointed towards the recovery of lost ground. However, recent terrorist attacks demonstrate that the threat continues to hang over the continent with potential negative impacts on demand.

The cargo business for the continent’s carriers is getting a demand boost from the weak Euro, improvement in world trade (with a direct positive impact on air cargo) and indications of political stability.

The continent is seeing slightly improved trading conditions with its largest economy (Brazil) emerging from recession. Political instability persists in many markets and rising costs in dollars (for fuel) presents challenges. Additionally the region suffers from an onerous regulatory burden on passenger rights. Brazil has been joined by Mexico with punitive passenger rights regimes that differ significantly from international norms. And the political chaos in Venezuela makes it unlikely there soon will be a recovery of $3.8 billion of airline revenues blocked from repatriation. Nonetheless, the region’s airlines are responding to these challenges and Latin America is expected to be the only region to see an improvement in its business fortunes compared to 2016.

Trading conditions for the Middle Eastern carriers have sharply declined over the last six months. Profitability and load factors are down significantly, as traffic and some business models have come under pressure. There is growing evidence that the ban on large electronic devices in the cabin and the uncertainty created around possible US travel bans is taking a toll on some key routes. Meanwhile the region is struggling with increased infrastructure taxes/charges and air traffic congestion.

African carriers remain in the red; but without a deterioration on 2016 performance. On safety, the region’s carriers achieved a major milestone with zero jet hull-losses in 2016. And a general improvement in commodity prices is helping invigorate the continent’s economies (and offset fuel price increases). This trend, however, is unlikely to accelerate substantially. The burdens of high taxes, higher-than-global-average fuel prices, competition from the Gulf and limited intra-continental liberalization remain. The balance of these factors is expected to result in continued small losses.

IATA revised downwards its estimation for 2016 profits to $34.8 billion (from previously forecast $35.6 billion). Industry level profitability peaked at a historically high level in the first half of 2016 and has since been slowly declining. This is the result of margins being squeezed by unit costs which are rising faster than unit revenues. Additionally, net post-tax profits took a hit from fuel hedging losses.

“Air transport is the business of freedom. The safe and efficient global movement of goods and people is a positive force in our world. Aviation’s success betters peoples’ lives by creating economic opportunity and supporting global understanding. We must stand firm in the face of any rhetoric that would put limits on aviation’s future success,” said de Juniac.

Some key indicators of the strength of global connectivity include:

Airlines are expected to take delivery of some 1,850 new aircraft in 2017, around half of which will replace older and less fuel-efficient aircraft. This will expand the global commercial fleet by 3.8% to 28,645.",air-traffic

"General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, Inc. (GA‑ASI) president David R. Alexander issued the following statement at the Civil Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) Conference during the Paris International Air Show.

GA-ASI applauds the FAA's effort to work with industry through the recently formed Controlled Airspace Advisory Rulemaking Committee and Type Certification Projects.

GA-ASI is working collaboratively across the aviation community to address the challenges of airspace integration in the areas of airworthiness, technology, regulations, and procedures. We think that international harmonization is critical to industry growth. In the near future, UAVs will be able to fly without special clearance and that has been our corporate goal for the last 25 years.

In the last 25 years, GA-ASI aircraft have flown more than 4.5 million flight hours, 600,000 of which were flown in 2016 alone. To put this into perspective, about 80 GA-ASI aircraft are airborne every second of the day. These operations are currently conducted at 75 locations worldwide. GA-ASI is learning new things about UAV airspace integration every day with our primary goal of safety. The term Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) is key to the way that we think about Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS). Our ""Remote Pilots"" are highly qualified aviation professionals who are rated to perform commercial operations.

On the airworthiness front, GA-ASI is working under private investment to develop the MQ-9B SkyGuardian™, a RPA that will comply with NATO's STANAG 4671, the only internationally recognized airworthiness regulation for large RPA. SkyGuardian is the baseline system for the UK's PROTECTOR program. We are proud to have the UK as our launch partner.

On the technology front, GA-ASI has been developing key RPA-related technologies for over six years. To answer the UAV issue of ""see and be seen,"" GA-ASI recently has been working with the FAA, NASA, and Honeywell to perform flight tests of an airborne Detect and Avoid (DAA) system on NASA's Ikhana, which contributed to the recently published RTCA DO-365 and DO-366 technical standards for DAA and a GA-ASI-developed Due Regard Airborne Radar.

We understand aviation is global and we have ambitions of operating all over the world, so GA-ASI is an active contributor to the U.S. Delegation to the ICAO RPA Panel. It is essential that industry, FAA, civil aviation, regulators, and export policy work together going forward and we predict that by 2027, UAVs ""file and fly"" will be common place.

The panel discussion was held in the GIFAS (Groupement des industries françaises aéronautiques et spatiales) International Chalet at the Paris Air Show and focused on ""technology at the service of (drones) regulation."" All approaches were illustrated by coordinated presentations from aviation authorities and industries, showing how collaboration between regulators and industry could lead to balanced regulations, protecting both the growth of the drone industry and the safety of people in the air and on the ground.

Mr. Alexander spoke as a representative of the Aerospace Industries Association (AIA) and was joined by Patrick Gandil, director general of the French Direction Générale de l'Aviation Civile (DGAC) in link with Jean-Brice Dumont (Airbus Helicopters CTO) speaking for GIFAS; Michael Huerta, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) administrator; Kah Han TAN, senior director safety regulations from the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore; Patrick KY, EASA executive director; and Florian Guillermet, SESAR JU executive director.",air-traffic

"EASA have published a Safety Information Bulletin (SIB) to remind pilots and air traffic controllers about the risks associated with wake turbulence encounters at high altitude and about the applicable precautionary measures.

Every flying aircraft generates turbulence in its wake. This wake turbulence consists of a pair of counter-rotating vortices that can persist for several minutes behind the generating airplane, naturally descending. Actual motion strongly depends on the prevailing wind and atmospheric conditions.

The likelihood for an airplane to encounter severe wake turbulence generated by another airplane is very low but cannot be excluded. Typically, the so-called “heavy” and “super heavy” aircraft (Airbus 340, Airbus 380, Boeing 747 as examples) are more prone to generate stronger vortices, although there is potential for other large aircraft types as well.

EASA is continuously monitoring with interested parties the risks associated to wake encounters en-route and publishes this SIB to inform the community about precautionary measures.",air-traffic
"Aireon have announced the successful launch and deployment of the second batch of 10 Iridium NEXT satellites, carrying its space-based automatic dependent surveillance broadcast (ADS-B) payloads.  This launch has increased the total number of Aireon payloads in orbit to 20 with another 55 destined for space in a series of six additional launches planned for the next twelve months.  Aireon’s technology will provide real-time, 100 percent global air traffic surveillance and tracking, which will for the first time bring aircraft visibility to all regions of the planet.

“With two successful launches under our belt, we are making great progress towards bringing our service to a reality,” said Vinny Capezzuto, chief technology officer and vice president of engineering, Aireon. “Just like with the first batch of our payloads, we will go through a rigorous process of testing and validating each individual payload, pushing their limits to maximize operational effectiveness.”

Since the first successful launch in January, Aireon has activated 8 payloads and has received over one billion aircraft position reports. In addition, the company has conducted successful flights tests with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and NAV CANADA, which validated the technology’s capabilities and allowed for further fine tuning.  The Aireon payloads, which were manufactured by Harris Corporation, will be hosted on all 81 Iridium NEXT satellites, 75 of which are scheduled for launch.  The operational Iridium NEXT constellation will consist of 66 satellites, with the remaining nine serving as on-orbit spares and six additional ground spares.",air-traffic
"SITAONAIR has hailed the successful launch of Iridium’s second set of Iridium NEXT constellation satellites as another step closer to achieving minute-by-minute, 100% global aircraft flight-tracking.

 

 In partnership with Aireon and FlightAware, SITAONAIR’s AIRCOM® FlightTracker will deliver enhanced capabilities to airline customers from 2018. Aireon’s space-based automatic dependent surveillance broadcast data (ADS-B) will then fill any gaps in current flight-tracking coverage globally – and is expected to be transmitted through the complete Iridium NEXT satellite constellation, via FlightAware.

 

 Paul Gibson, Portfolio Director, AIRCOM®, at SITAONAIR, says: “This is an exciting moment for SITAONAIR as the second set of satellites start their journey to enabling us to deliver 100% global, real-time flight-tracking to the air transport industry. We are looking forward to seeing the project progress and being able to demonstrate its value to airlines.

 

 “The beauty of adding space-based ADS-B data to our current AIRCOM® FlightTracker is that it will integrate seamlessly into the existing interface, while increasing tracking coverage up to 100%. In short, the airlines who adopt our space-based flight-tracking will have the tools to see the precise position, speed and altitude of all airborne fleet – any time, anywhere – and be immediately alerted if any aircraft veers from its flight plan, even if that route is over ocean or the Poles.

 

 “With real-time alerts generated at least once a minute, airlines with enhanced FlightTracker will be way ahead of the ICAO’s best practice one-minute mandate – truly consolidating their commitment to safe travel.



SITAONAIR’s AIRCOM® FlightTracker is currently used by over 60 airlines worldwide.

Paul continues: “The SITAONAIR Montreal Development Team has already determined how the new space-based ADS-B data should be integrated and presented within FlightTracker. The display uses specific color-coding to identify different data sources, and, for us, it is a case of drawing in this data and giving space-based ADS-B its own distinct place in this set.”

"To enhance the performance of air traffic control (ATC) stations and increase safety, an advanced radio direction finder system has been rolled out in a crowded segment of European airspace. A key component of the system is a precise and accurate digital direction finder from Rohde & Schwarz.

Commercial aircraft flying in the airspace that is controlled by EUROCONTROL's Maastricht Upper Area Control Center (MUAC) are enjoying an extra measure of safety today thanks to the installation of a radio direction finding (RDF) system that employs Rohde & Schwarz products. In the first phase of a deployment that helps air traffic controllers locate and track aircraft voice communications, four RDF units have been in operational use since October 2016. The complete rollout of seven units in Belgium, the Netherlands and northwest Germany is planned by the end of June 2017.

More than 1.77 million flights pass through MUAC's area of responsibility each year, making it the third busiest air traffic control facility in Europe in terms of traffic volume. In this densely populated airspace, 25 aircraft are often being controlled at any one time in a single sector. Radiolocation based on RDF helps controllers quickly locate which aircraft are transmitting on each frequency. RDF technology accurately calculates a transmitting aircraft's area by analyzing its radio transmissions. This helps reduce call sign confusion, readbacks from wrong aircraft and crossed transmissions. Patrick Bardet, project manager at EUROCONTROL, comments: ""RDF makes working with heavy traffic easier for air traffic controllers because it gives them an idea of which aircraft is calling, saving them precious seconds, especially when aircraft have similar call signs.""

At the system level, all data from the different RDF stations is collected and processed centrally at MUAC. Measurement results are collected from each RDF and also at several frequencies of interest in parallel, enabling air traffic controllers to monitor the desired frequencies in their allocated flight sector.

The EUROCONTROL system uses the R&S DDF04E direction finder from Rohde & Schwarz, which features parallel direction finding on multiple channels with the same high level of accuracy on all channels. A wide-aperture DF antenna with nine antenna elements is used to collect the aircraft's radio transmission data, which is analyzed according to the correlative interferometer direction finding method. This combination provides high accuracy, sensitivity and outstanding immunity to reflections. Direction finding can be accomplished on as many as 32 channels simultaneously with the same high level of performance. Software for the flexible management of the frequency channels is embedded in the direction finder.

The European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation (EUROCONTROL) is an intergovernmental organisation with 41 Member States and 2 comprehensive agreement states. EUROCONTROL, together with its partners, is committed to building a Single European Sky that will deliver the air traffic management (ATM) performance required for the twenty-first century and beyond.

The Eurocontrol RDF project is co-financed by the Innovation and Networks Executive Agency (INEA).

"HENSOLDT, the new sensor house, has entered into a collaboration in the area of counter-UAV with sensor provider Squarehead Technology AS, Oslo. At Xponential, Dallas/Texas, HENSOLDT signed a collaboration agreement with Squarehead which adds its acoustic sensor “Discovair” to HENSOLDT’s “Xpeller” counter-UAV portfolio.

“Together with our partners, we have created a modular counter-UAV system which is extremely effective”, said Thomas Müller, CEO of HENSOLDT. “Xpeller demonstrates HENSOLDT’s innovative capabilities, answering our customer’s needs to detect and protect from new threats. Due to its versatility, Xpeller is able to offer maximum protection under a variety of conditions and ranges”.

""We are excited to see how well our sensor is received by the integrator industry, and are very sure HENSOLDT's integrated system will benefit greatly from the use of it. The collaboration is a major sensor-fusion combined effort, proving that acoustics will remain a cornerstone of the drone detection industry - with our unique sensor array at the heart of it"", says Stig Nyvold (CEO) of Squarehead Technology AS.

The modular “Xpeller” product family consists of HENSOLDT’s own products – radars, infrared cameras and long-range jammers – and close-in RF detectors from Danish partner company myDefence. With Discovair, the acoustic signature of drones can be used to detect and track such threats with a high grade of certainty up to a distance of several hundred meters. Thus, Squarehead’s product complements the existing set of Xpeller sensors in the near-field and line-of-sight area.

“Xpeller” offers very high effectiveness by combining sensor data from different sources with latest data fusion, signal analysis and jamming technologies. It uses radars, optical and other sensors to detect and identify the drone and assess its threat potential at ranges from a few hundred metres up to several kilometers depending on the type of drone. Based on an extensive threat library and real-time analysis of control signals a jammer then interrupts the link between drone and pilot and/or its navigation. The modular “Xpeller” system concept relies on the selection of individual devices from the product family depending on customer requirements and local conditions. “Xpeller” has been tested extensively at HENSOLDT’s own premises and during customer presentations in Germany, France and Switzerland. An operational system is available on the market with delivery time depending on the required configuration.",air-traffic

"NATS, the UK based air traffic management company, has announced a partnership with NAV CANADA with both parties taking an equal shareholding in the Canadian firm, Searidge Technologies.

Searidge works with airports around the world, providing technology that helps reduce delays, increase efficiency, and overall safety. This includes the delivery of ‘digital’ tower solutions, which see air traffic controllers managing aircraft from remote facilities instead of in traditional airport towers.

Searidge will continue to operate as an independent company. The investment by NATS sees it become a joint and equal owner alongside NAV CANADA, and is illustrative of the growing demand for digital tower solutions from airports around the world.

Martin Rolfe, NATS Chief Executive Officer, said: “Digital tower technology has the potential to completely transform the delivery of air navigation services at airports and we’ve been incredibly impressed by what Searidge offers. That’s why we’ve chosen to invest. Their highly innovative approach and proven technology combined with the wealth of operational experience and resource that both we and NAV CANADA can provide means we can offer airports around the world something that is uniquely compelling.”

Moodie Cheikh, CEO, Searidge Technologies, added: “We are excited as Searidge takes this important next step in its growth. We strongly believe ownership by two tier one Air Navigation Service Providers will allow Searidge to better service our customers, expand our reach into key markets and help drive innovation in an operational environment.

“We remain committed to our staff and customers and making Searidge the market leader we envisioned over 10 years ago when we founded the company.”

Digital ‘remote’ tower technology looks set to revolutionise air traffic management services over the coming years. Instead of a physical tower, high definition, day and night visible, thermal and pan-tilt-zoom cameras provide real-time information to air traffic controllers that could be hundreds or even thousands of miles away. There, the view of the airfield is recreated as a seamless panoramic image that can be augmented and enhanced with a host of operational and sensory data; from radar and flight information on individual aircraft, to the location of closed taxiways.

This digital set-up improves a controller’s situational awareness, thereby offering safety and operational benefits, while also being substantially more cost effective for the airport.

Searidge was the first in the world to have an operational video system in an air traffic control tower and has since developed a range of scalable and customisable digital tower solutions designed to work at airports of any size, from small and geographically remote airfields, through to major international hubs. Most recently it also unveiled the world’s first artificial intelligence platform for Air Traffic Management.

It now operates in more than 30 sites in 16 countries, with the investment by NATS seen as a way to support its further expansion.

“NAV CANADA recognised the huge potential in Searidge early on,” said Neil Wilson, President and CEO, NAV CANADA. “Over the last six years, Searidge has done a great job of growing the business and evolving its technology into a market-leading contender in the remote tower space. Building on our existing partnership with NATS, this new venture will allow us to take Searidge to the next level of growth and success.”

The investment in Searidge has been made by NATS Services, the commercial arm of the UK ANSP.

"The Board of Directors of ENAV S.p.A. held today under the chairmanship of Mr. Roberto Scaramella approved the Preliminary Financial Report at 31 March 2017.

The first quarter 2017 results were solid, despite the typical seasonality of traffic flows, which in this period of the year marks the lowest level of activity, while costs normally tend to remain linear throughout the year. It is worth noting that Q1 2017, compared to last year, was characterised by one day less (2016 was a leap year) and the absence of traffic flows during Easter holidays, as this year Easter fell in April, whereas in 2016 it fell in March, with a consequential impact on en-route and terminal traffic.

Despite the positive trend in international traffic, which increased by 0.6%, total en-route traffic in terms of service units (a conventional weighted measurement unit which takes in to the aircraft weight at take-off and, in case of en-route traffic, the distance travelled in Italian airspace) declined by 1%, mainly as a result of the weak domestic traffic, which fell 2.9%, and the 2% decline in overflight traffic due to the persistence of a no-fly zone over Libya, which negatively affects the routes between Europe and Africa – leading to a loss of traffic flying through the Italian airspace.

Terminal traffic, in terms of service units (i.e. takeoff and landing activities within a radius of 20 km from runway) declined marginally by 0.6% over Q1 2016. By contrast, the major north Italian airports (Milan Malpensa, Milan Linate, Bergamo Orio al Serio and Venice Tessera) saw an overall 2.6% growth in service units.

Total consolidated net revenue at 31 March 2017 fell 0.5% vs. 2016 to 176.4 million euro.

Revenue from operations grew 2.5% to 161.5 million euro, driven by ENAV’s core business revenue which reached 158.3 million, up 2.3% compared to Q1 2016. This increase is mainly attributable to the positive performance of service units in the larger north Italian airports as well as the different tariff dynamics applied to low traffic airports. The terminal revenue grew a strong 7.5% to 43.4 million. The growth of revenue from operations was also driven by the 16% increase in revenue from non-regulated activities which reached 3.1 million euro.

The balance – whereby ENAV recovers from, or returns to, carriers the effects arising from the difference between air-traffic level estimated in the charging scheme and the actual level, and totally recovers traffic level and costs for services provided in low traffic airports - contributed 6.3 million euro to total revenue (45.2% below last year’s contribution).

In the first quarter of 2017, ENAV continued to deliver on its efficiency-improvement plan by optimizing specific cost items and streamlining the processes between the Group companies.

Operating costs were reduced by 1.1% to 147.7 million euro over last year. In particular, personnel costs fell 0.1% following a reduction in the Group headcount by 18 average units and 36 units in absolute terms. This personnel cost trend was all the more significant considering the training costs incurred for the implementation of the Free Route Platform, an innovative service which reduces flight distances, launched by ENAV last December ahead of all other European service providers. Thanks to Free Route, airlines flying through the Italian airspace save approximately 162,000 kg of fuel on a daily basis.

External costs declined by 3.2% YoY to 36.1 million mainly as a result of the savings achieved from the renegotiation of insurance costs and a more efficient spare parts management on maintenance.

Consolidated EBITDA at31 March 2017 grew 2.6% over the previous year to 28.7 million euro, with a 16.3% EBITDA margin, an increase of 0.5 p.p. over the margin of 15.8% recorded at 31 March 2016.

Consolidated EBIT was negative for 2.9 million euro with a significant improvement over the negative 6.7 million euro of Q1 2016.

ENAV closed the first quarter of 2017 with a negative net result of 4.2 million euro, a material improvement compared to the 8.8 million-euro loss of the first quarter 2016. As noted, the first quarter reflects the typical negative impact of air traffic seasonality on top-line, while costs remain linear throughout the period.

In Q1 2017, ENAV’s net financial debt reached 125.6 million euro, an increase of 25.5 million euro compared to Q1 2016. This negative variation in net financial position is mainly attributable to the payment of the third instalment of the investment in Aireon - the company developing the first global air traffic satellite surveillance system scheduled to be launched in 2018 - and to the lower cash balance following payments to suppliers.",air-traffic

"The International Air Transport Association (IATA) released March 2017 demand growth results for global air freight markets showing a 14% expansion measured in freight tonne kilometers (FTKs) compared to the same period last year. This was the fastest pace of growth recorded since October 2010. Freight capacity, measured in available freight tonne kilometers (AFTKs), grew by 4.2% year-on-year in March 2017.

March performance contributed to very strong first quarter (Q1) growth in freight volumes. After adjusting for the impact of the leap year in 2016, freight demand in Q1 2017 increased by nearly 11%. Capacity increased by 3.7% over the same period (leap year adjusted).

The strengthening of air freight demand in March is consistent with an uptick in world trade and a six-year high in new export orders. An increase in the shipment of silicon materials typically used in high-value consumer electronics shipped by air, is also likely underpinning a portion of the strong performance.

""March capped a robust first quarter with the strongest year-on-year air freight growth in six-and-a-half years. Optimism is returning to the industry as the business stabilizes after many years in the doldrums. There is, however, still much lost ground to recover while facing the dual headwinds of rising fuel and labor costs. It remains critical to use the improvement in the industry’s fortunes as an opportunity to enhance the value offering by implementing modern customer-centric initiatives that streamline processes and reduce costs,"" said Alexandre de Juniac, IATA’s Director General and CEO.

¹% of industry FTKs in 2016   ²Year-on-year change in load factor   ³Load factor level

All regions, with the exception of Latin America, reported year-on-year increases in demand in March 2017.  Airlines in Europe and Asia-Pacific posted the strongest growth accounting for two-thirds of the industry-wide increase in demand. The remaining growth was split between North American and Middle Eastern carriers, with African airlines making a modest contribution.

Asia-Pacific airlines’ freight volumes expanded 13.6% in March 2017 compared to the same period a year earlier and capacity increased by 4.8%. The increase in volumes reflects the strength of the order books reported by exporters across the region. Seasonally-adjusted volumes increased in March and are now back to levels reached in 2010 during the post-global financial crisis bounce-back. Demand has strengthened considerably on all key routes to and from Asia over the last six months with the exception of Pacific routes (Asia to North America).

North American carriers posted an increase in freight volumes of 9.5% in March 2017, and a capacity increase of 2.8%. International freight volumes increased 14.2% over the same period – the fastest pace since the boost to air freight from the consequences of congestion at US West Coast seaports in 2015. Seasonally-adjusted volumes have slowed to a near standstill alongside a weakening in demand in Pacific routes. The further strengthening of the US dollar continues to boost the inbound freight market but is keeping the export market under pressure.

European airlines posted an 18.2% increase in freight volumes in March 2017 and a capacity increase of 6.7%. International freight volumes grew by 18.1% year-on-year, the fastest pace in six years. Seasonally-adjusted freight volumes continue to trend upwards. The ongoing weakness of the Euro persists in boosting the performance of the European freight market which has benefitted from strong export orders over the last few months.

Middle Eastern carriers’ year-on-year freight volumes increased 16.3% in March 2017 and capacity increased 2.7%. International freight volumes increased 16.4% year-on-year in March – the fastest pace since June 2015. Seasonally-adjusted freight volumes maintained their upward trend. The year-on-year growth rate has recovered after having moderated in late-2015 and is now back in line with the long-run average. Demand remains strong between the Middle East and Europe but traffic to Asia has weakened.

Latin American airlines experienced a contraction in demand of 4.2% in March 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. Capacity decreased by 1.9% over the same period. Freight volumes have now been in contractionary territory in 26 out of the last 28 months. Recovery in seasonally-adjusted volumes also stalled with demand in March reaching its lowest level since October 2010. Demand is now 18% lower than at the peak in 2014. The region’s carriers have managed to adjust capacity, which has limited the negative impact on the load factor.

African carriers’ posted the largest year-on-year increase in demand of all regions in March 2017 with freight volumes growing 33.5%. Capacity increased by 6.3% over the same time. Demand has been boosted by very strong growth on the trade lanes to and from Asia following an increase in direct services between the continents. The increase in demand has helped the region’s load factor rise by 6 percentage points compared to March 2016.",air-traffic

The delegation was accompanied by a representative of the Spanish Ministry of Transport and SESAR Deployment Manager (SDM), the industrial partnership that synchronises and coordinates the modernisation of Europe’s air traffic management system under the political oversight of the European Commission.

""I am happy to see that CEF funding helps to achieve ambitious implementation goals. The modernisation of ENAIRE's Communication and ATM system will enable deployment of further SESAR solutions to harmonise the European sky. This will bring direct benefits to passengers by increasing safety and decreasing air travel costs,"" said Andreas Boschen, Head of CEF Department, INEA.

“Achieving the Single European Sky (SES) performance objectives, as well as the overall economic benefits expected from the ATM modernisation, is linked to the timely, coordinated and synchronised deployment of SESAR”, said Ángel Luis Arias, Director General at ENAIRE.

“ENAIRE is fully committed to delivering SESAR operational capabilities into Spanish airspace and today we are very pleased to welcome INEA and the European Commission and showcase the progress and tangible benefits our implementation projects bring to our customers and the entire European ATM network.""

“ENAIRE's efforts to continue to modernise the Spanish ATM were clearly demonstrated during the visit. I am happy that co-funded modernisation projects, under the coordination of SESAR Deployment Manager, are initiated and implemented. I am also proud of the effective and actual cooperation with ENAIRE, as well as the other involved industries, which are contributing to the achievement of SES goals,"" said Massimo Garbini, Managing Director SESAR Deployment Manager.

The objective of the project is the modernisation of the existing ENAIRE’s aeronautical data network, called REDAN, in order to align its technology with the current and future state-of-the-art facilities. The nodes of this network are located in the control centres and towers and in communication centres supporting all data communications involved in the provision of CNS/ATM services offered by ENAIRE.

REDAN ensures an agreed level of ground-ground interconnectivity between ENAIRE air traffic service units and airspace users with the highest levels of availability and security. This deployment will facilitate information exchange with the communication requirements of new applications, voice and data integration and the reduction of maintenance and operation costs.

During the visit to Madrid, Spain delegates were guided through the ENAIRE ATM centralised systems, the Madrid Air Traffic Control Centre (ACC) and the Spanish ATM system test platform in ENAIRE headquarters. The visitors had the opportunity to see a live demonstration, one of the multiple applications of the network, the Electronic Flight Strips (EFS), also co-financed by the European Commission in CEF Call 2014 and 2015.",air-traffic
"Aireon announced that NAV CANADA has completed a successful flight test of space-based Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) technology. The test was conducted to collect ADS-B data used for validating Aireon’s satellite aircraft surveillance and tracking service. The NAV CANADA flight occurred on March 7, 2017 and utilized a specially equipped Bombardier aircraft with both top and bottom mounted 125 watt ADS-B antennas. It was the first of two scheduled flight tests by the Canadian Air Navigation Service Provider (ANSP). Additional flight tests were done by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Polaris Flight Systems.



 

NAV CANADA's specially equipped Bombardier aircraft with both top and bottom mounted 125 watt ADS-B antennas

During the flight test, 6,935 ADS-B messages were received and decoded by a single Aireon payload, and after rigorous analysis, were found to exhibit comparable results to that of terrestrial ADS-B stations. Traveling through the Montreal, Winnipeg and Edmonton Flight Information Regions (FIRs), the flight test was a highly choreographed exercise requiring the aircraft to position itself in the correct airspace while the appropriate Iridium NEXT satellite carrying the Aireon ADS-B receiver was overhead.

An additional flight test with the FAA took place on Thursday, March 30, 2017, utilizing the FAA’s specially equipped “flying laboratory” Bombardier jet with three Aireon payloads available to receive data. A total of 2,462 ADS-B messages were received and decoded while also exhibiting comparable results to that of terrestrial ADS-B stations. The FAA flight test took place in the Washington and New York FIRs.

Aireon also conducted a flight test with Polaris Flight Systems, a private vendor, on March 20, 2017. The aircraft, a Beechcraft Bonanza, was outfitted with a top and bottom mounted 200 watt ADS-B antenna and flew solely through the Albuquerque FIR, where more than 1,050 ADS-B messages were received from two Aireon payloads during the flight.

“The flight tests coordinated with NAV CANADA, the FAA, and Polaris Flight Systems have been remarkable successes and further enable our team to thoroughly validate the capabilities of our system,” said Vinny Capezzuto, chief technology officer and vice president, engineering at Aireon. “Through multiple flight information regions, with various levels of aircraft traffic, these tests were able to put our system through some challenging environments, and the data we’ve received is incredibly strong.”

“NAV CANADA is excited to play such an important role in helping to bring the next-generation of air traffic surveillance and aircraft tracking to the world,” said Rudy Kellar, executive vice president, service delivery at NAV CANADA. “Aireon will fundamentally change the way the world flies, increasing safety, efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The benefits will find their way right down to the individual traveler who will benefit from more predictable flight times and more efficient airport ground operations.”

Aireon’s space-based ADS-B system will be operational in 2018, providing ANSPs with global air traffic surveillance and airlines with real-time flight tracking. The first ten Iridium NEXT satellites carrying the Aireon hosted-payloads were launched into low-Earth-orbit from Vandenberg Air Force Base on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket on January 14, 2017. Seven additional SpaceX launches are scheduled to take place over the next 12 to 15 months, including the second launch targeted for June of 2017. In total, the operational constellation will consist of 66 satellites, with an additional nine serving as on-orbit spares.",air-traffic
"Inmarsat (ISAT.L), the world’s leading provider of global mobile satellite communications, has more than 1,000 expected aircraft under signed contracts, both installed and as a backlog, for its next-generation GX Aviation and European Aviation Network (EAN) inflight broadband services.

The milestone was celebrated during an evening reception with airline customers, partners and the media at the Aircraft Interiors Expo (AIX) in Hamburg, Germany last night.

The fast-growing backlog, which includes aircraft that have either been installed or are awaiting installation, is a major endorsement of Inmarsat’s strategy to make the connected aircraft a reality. It follows a succession of leading airline customers that have selected to equip their fleet with Inmarsat’s GX Aviation and EAN services, including Lufthansa Group, International Airlines Group (IAG), Air New Zealand, Singapore Airlines, Norwegian Air and Air Asia.

Lufthansa Group was the first customer to commence installation of GX Aviation on their aircraft last year. They have already fitted out more than 50 aircraft, a number that is expected to increase to 200 aircraft by the end of this year. GX Aviation provides inflight broadband for Lufthansa’s FlyNet Wi-Fi offering, which launched under a test phase in February this year.

Inmarsat signed a deal with International Airlines Group (IAG) earlier this year to be the launch partner for the European Aviation Network (EAN), which will provide passengers with unparalleled inflight connectivity across Europe. IAG plans to equip in excess of 300 aircraft across British Airways, Aer Lingus, Iberia and Vueling and aims to have 90% of its short haul fleet complete by early 2019.

Leo Mondale, President of Inmarsat Aviation, said: “The fact we have crossed more than 1,000 aircraft in backlog at this point is an incredible milestone, given that GX Aviation only went live a few months ago. It is further proof that the inflight broadband revolution has truly begun; passengers are demanding quality connectivity and airlines are endorsing Inmarsat’s superior offering. We are deeply engaged with additional airlines worldwide, so this really is just the tip of the iceberg. The message is clear: we are coming to a plane near you!”

Inmarsat is transforming global aviation with GX Aviation, which gives passengers the same fast and reliable connection in the air that they previously only found on the ground. The world’s first global, consistent, high-speed broadband service from a single provider, GX Aviation went live in 2016.

The European Aviation Network (EAN) is the first solution to combine the ‘best of two worlds’; integrating connectivity from a satellite, operated by Inmarsat, and a complementary LTE-based ground network, operated by Deutsche Telekom. EAN remains on track to enter service this year.",air-traffic

"Bremen Airport, in the north of Germany, was the setting for a German first. It was the first time that a passenger aircraft landed in Germany using a new satellite-based precision approach procedure without the aid of the conventional ground-based navigation infrastructure. This was made possible by EGNOS (European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service), a satellite-based augmentation system (SBAS) that supplements GPS and other satellite navigation systems. It improves the position accuracy of GPS from 10-20 metres to 1-3 meters. Bremen is the first airport in Germany to have implemented a precision approach procedure using SBAS.

SBAS provides an innovative alternative to the conventional instrument landing system (ILS) and can also be used in poor weather conditions. DFS has thus provided airspace users in Bremen with a workable alternative to the old system. This is not the first time that Bremen Airport was on the cutting edge of air navigation technology. In 2012, the world's first approach using a ground-based augmentation system (GBAS) for satellite navigation was employed.

The International Civil Aviation Organisation ICAO approved the satellite-based SBAS precision approach procedure, giving it the name ""LPV 200"". The procedure can be implemented in poor visibility for category I (CAT I) weather conditions, one of three levels of all-weather operations. The pilot is guided down to a height of 200 feet above ground, that is about 60 metres, using satellite-based technology that guides the aeroplane horizontally and vertically. When the pilot has the runway in sight, it is safe to land.

Up until now, it has only been possible to guide aircraft to what is known as the ""decision height"" by means of ground-based systems such as ILS or systems such as GBAS, which supplement the satellite guidance with a ground-based station. The new SBAS technology offers clear advantages compared to conventional approach procedures. In addition to being an extremely precise alternative to ILS, SBAS does not require ground infrastructure that is expensive to operate and requires a lot of maintenance.

EGNOS geostationary satellites supplement GPS signals to achieve the high degree of precision for the SBAS procedure. Together, they fulfil the requirements needed for precision approach procedures and comply with ICAO standards.

""In the medium- and long term, DFS is planning on making more use of satellite-based navigation for approaches and thus create an alternative to the traditional ILS category I,"" explained Andre Biestmann, Director of Airspace and ANS Support at DFS.

Aircraft cockpits have to be equipped with EGNOS receivers to be able to receive the satellite signals. A majority of the NetJets company's aircraft in Europe are already equipped with this new technology and it was a NetJets aircraft that conducted this first SBAS approach in Bremen.

The modern fleet of NetJets makes the company an important contributor to aviation innovation. In autumn 2016, NetJets and DFS tested the latest approach procedures with GBAS. This project was awarded an innovation prize by the European Commission in early March 2017 as part of the Augmented Approaches to Land project.

Not all aircraft manufacturers equip their aeroplanes with EGNOS receivers. DFS believes that incentives will have to be created so that aircraft can be equipped with this technology in the long term.

DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung has operated a ground-based augmentation system (GBAS) at Bremen Airport since February 2012. This type of approach procedure also uses the satellite signals of the US global positioning system (GPS). The ground-based antennas provide data that improve the precision of the satellite data and then send this information to the approaching aircraft. The SBAS procedure does not use this type of ground-based facility.

"On 4 April, 2017, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed by Frank Brenner, the Director General of EUROCONTROL and Josef Doppelbauer, the Executive Director of the European Union Agency for Railways. The Memorandum covers closer cooperation between the Agencies to enhance aviation and railway safety, in particular on promoting Just Culture by using joint courses, seminars and workshops.

Frank Brenner commented “Establishing a Just Culture is vital for making sure that safety-related events and incidents are properly and openly reported so that we can learn from them. There is a real benefit for both aviation and railways to work together, for example with prosecutors, to spread the message about what Just Culture is and what its benefits are.”

Josef Doppelbauer said “We are delighted to work together with EUROCONTROL to promote Just Culture. Improving safety today means learning not just from accidents, which are rare, but also from any incident or event which demonstrates a weakness in the system. Everyone in the industry needs to feel supported and encouraged to come forward and share their experience.”

Under a ‘Just Culture’ individuals are not blamed for ‘honest errors’ but are held accountable for wilful violations and gross negligence. It promotes an atmosphere of trust in which people are encouraged to provide safety-related information and it supports learning from unsafe acts. Key to its implementation is not only the approach of management but also the legal response to ‘honest errors’.

"In daily operations, pilots are benefiting from direct routings – known as 'tactical directs' – offered flexibly by air traffic controllers (ATCOs) on the frequency during the actual flight. With these tactical directs, ATCOs are eliminating a source of inefficiency that occurs if individual flight plans do not use the most efficient routing. Overall, in 2016 these tactical directs resulted in an average reduction of 15 kilometres in the distance flown per flight when compared with the routing originally planned, with the average distance flown declining from 528 kilometres to 513 kilometres per flight. The benefit for airspace users can be expressed in the reduction of fuel burned of 278,000 tons, or in monetary terms EUR 352 million. Beside this, air traffic controllers reduced the environmental footprint of aviation by 938,000 tons of CO2.

“We are glad to provide flexible services to the airspace users,” said Michiel van Dorst, CEO LVNL and FABEC CEO Champion Operations. “The example of tactical directs demonstrates that close collaboration between all partners and at all levels is key to an efficient aviation industry – for the sake of passengers,  the European economy and the environment.”

Tactical directs are one of the means of improving the service quality of air navigation services. To manage the high complexity and congestion within their airspace, FABEC air navigation service providers have developed several flexible tools to improve operations to the greatest extent possible, such as conditional routes or seasonal procedures improving flight profiles.",air-traffic
"The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is using its existing authority under Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) § 99.7 – “Special Security Instructions” – to address national security concerns about unauthorized drone operations over 133 military facilities.

This is the first time the agency has instituted airspace restrictions that specifically apply only to unmanned aircraft, popularly known as “drones.” The authority under § 99.7 is limited to requests based on national security interests from the Department of Defense and U.S. federal security and intelligence agencies.

U.S. military facilities are vital to the nation’s security. The FAA and the Department of Defense have agreed to restrict drone flights up to 400 feet within the lateral boundaries of these 133 facilities. The restrictions will be effective April 14, 2017.There are only a few exceptions that permit drone flights within these restrictions, and they must be coordinated with the individual facility and/or the FAA.

Operators who violate the airspace restrictions may be subject to enforcement action, including potential civil penalties and criminal charges.

To ensure the public is aware of these restricted locations, the FAA has created an interactive map online. The link to these restrictions is also included in the FAA’s B4UFLY mobile app. The app will be updated within 60 days to reflect these airspace restrictions. Additional information, including frequently asked questions, is available on the FAA’s UAS website.

Section 2209 of the FAA Extension, Safety, and Security Act of 2016 also directs the Secretary of Transportation to establish a process to accept petitions to prohibit or restrict UAS operations over critical infrastructure and other facilities. The Department of Transportation and the FAA are currently evaluating options to implement such a process.

It's Laminar Data Platform gathers and aggregates aviation data, such as flight, weather and aeronautical information, for customers including airlines, airports, air navigation service providers (ANSPs) and other companies in the aviation supply chain.

Established in 2001, Snowflake initially specialised in mapping software, and its customers were primarily in the UK. Since developing its aviation products, however, it has grown rapidly – 30% year-on-year organic growth for the last three years – and acquired customers around the world. In addition to sales in the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the Middle East, it has opened an office in Washington to support its sales in the Americas.

When Snowflake won a multi-million pound contract with the UAE General Civil Aviation Authority to provide a bespoke on-premise solution, the success created funding constraints. As part of the terms of the contract, the buyer required a performance bond of 10% from Snowflake’s bank. In turn, the bank required a cash deposit to issue the bond, which would have restricted the working capital available to fulfil the order and continue investing in the growth of the business.

UKEF was able to provide a solution. By giving the bank a guarantee under its bond support scheme, it reduced the size of the deposit required, freeing up the cashflow to fulfil the contract.

“Snowflake Software is a highly innovative company with a product for which there is significant global demand, and this Government is committed to ensuring that businesses like these can realise the world of opportunity out there. I am delighted that UK Export Finance was on hand to ensure that Snowflake was able to achieve this major export success.”

“UKEF’s support meant that we were able to release cash back into the business to maintain our focus on delivering a world class product to the customer and expand our business activities elsewhere. With our plans for further international growth, partnering with UKEF in future will give us the confidence that we can continue to realise the opportunities presented by this huge global industry.”",air-traffic
"The sensor house HENSOLDT will equip the German civil air navigation service provider DFS with state-of-the-art radar technology: DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung GmbH has commissioned HENSOLDT to deliver two units of the company’s high-performance ASR-NG® airport surveillance radar and a separate MSSR 2000 I® secondary radar for the purpose of modernising their radar infrastructure. Thanks to its outstanding detection capability, the ASR-NG is able to replace not only the existing approach control radar systems at the airports, but also the medium-range radar units, which have been in service for more than 30 years.

“Our ASR-NG offers top performance and an excellent price-performance ratio at the same time – not only for military, but also for civil air traffic control,” said Thomas Müller, CEO of HENSOLDT. “It guarantees the highest level of reliability in air traffic control, thus ensuring that people can benefit from maximum safety when travelling by air.

"Aireon and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) today announced a successful flight test of space-based Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) technology, collecting ADS-B data to be used as part of a larger validation effort exploring the new system’s capability from low-earth orbit.  The flight took place on Thursday, March 30, 2017, utilizing the FAA’s specially equipped “flying laboratory” Bombardier jet with three AireonSM payloads available to receive data.  A total of 2,462 ADS-B messages were received and decoded providing comparable data to that of terrestrial ADS-B stations.  The flight test was highly choreographed and precisely located and timed within the Washington and New York Flight Information Regions (FIRs) to help provide validation of the capabilities of the Aireon system.

Made possible by the FAA’s NextGen program, the coordinated flight test involved trials of 125 watt top and bottom-mounted antennas on the FAA’s “flying laboratory” jet known as N47.  The aircraft is specially retrofitted with highly calibrated antennas, flight-data test equipment and recorders. Based out of the FAA William J. Hughes Technical Center in Atlantic City, New Jersey, the N47 aircraft helped begin the evaluation and verification of the performance of the Aireon system, particularly in high interference and high density environments. Aireon’s space-based ADS-B global surveillance and aircraft tracking technology is largely a combination of FAA NextGen advancements, and the Iridium® NEXT satellite constellation, which hosts the Aireon ADS-B receivers.

“A flight test coordinated with the FAA was the ultimate validation accomplishment for the Aireon system to date and is a textbook example of how a public-private partnership can thrive.  It is nearly impossible to have a higher fidelity test without the experts at the FAA,” says Vinny Capezzuto, chief technology officer and vice president of engineering at Aireon. “The NextGen team and the N47 flight crew are the industry all-stars when it comes to testing and validating technologies.  Our ADS-B payloads are really an extension of the NextGen team’s work to-date, ensuring air traffic controllers have the tools they need for the continued safety and efficiency of global travel.”

The FAA Tech Center is a pillar of NextGen infrastructure and home to some of the most important advancements in aviation industry history.  Among the tests being conducted by the Tech Center team will be the comparative analysis of the Aireon space-based ADS-B data to that of existing ADS-B ground-station data.

“The collaboration between Aireon, its service partner Harris, and the FAA is a testament to our goal of working with industry to continue pushing NextGen technology forward,” says Andy Leone, surveillance and broadcast services, systems engineering lead/test director at the FAA. “The Aireon/Harris team has built a system that has huge potential for improving services for many around the world who lack some surveillance or advanced separation tools, and we are independently validating that their space-based ADS-B service meets FAA established performance requirements for broadcast surveillance. This test further exemplifies the FAA’s and NextGen program’s commitment to improving air traffic safety and efficiency for global aviation.”

Aireon’s space-based ADS-B system will be operational in 2018, shortly after completion of the Iridium NEXT satellite constellation.  The service will provide Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs) with global air traffic surveillance and airlines with real-time flight tracking.  The first ten Iridium NEXT satellites carrying the Aireon hosted-payloads were launched into low-Earth-orbit from Vandenberg Air Force Base on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, on January 14, 2017.  Seven additional SpaceX launches are scheduled to take place over the next 12 to 15 months, including the second launch now targeted for June of 2017.  In total, the operational constellation will consist of 66 satellites, with an additional nine serving as on-orbit spares.",air-traffic

"The AeroSpace and Defence Industries Association of Europe (ASD) welcomes the fruitful debate held during a high level lunch hosted by MEP and President of the Sky and Space Intergroup

Monika Hohlmeier on the aviation’s way forward to reduce its environmental footprint.



Monika Hohlmeier, MEP, opened the discussion by highlighting that as a global actor, Europe plays a key role in international efforts to promote a sustainable environmental framework. “With doubling of flights expected until 2035, we need to strengthen our efforts in developing global solutions to curb carbon emissions from air travel” added Mrs Hohlmeier. She also stressed that addressing environmental issues and maintaining a competitive EU presence on the global market can and must go hand in hand, whereby environmental policy can play a key role in creating jobs.



Michael Gill, International Air Transport Association (IATA) Global Director for Environment, emphasised that aviation is the first and only industry so far to proactively come together and agree on a common strategy to address its CO2 emissions at a global level. In this respect, IATA applauded the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and its Member States for reaching an agreement on the first ever global Market Based Measure (MBM) aimed at tackling global civil aviation emissions. In this regard, Mr Gill highlighted the EU’s strong commitment in the ICAO process which will need to be translated into the full implementation of the Carbon offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) for all international flights, which includes under ICAO definition, intra-EU international flights. “CORSIA will reduce emissions by over 2.5

billion tons of CO2 between 2021 and 2035” emphasised Mr Gill. He also added: “our colleagues in the manufacturing sector are continually researching and developing new aircraft technology, with each new generation of aircraft and engine being roughly 20% more efficient than the previous models. However, to meet the 2050 targets of emissions reduction, we also need the support of policy makers to provide a favorable regulatory environment and investment policy which will, in particular, help reaching efficiency with better infrastructure and air traffic management and encourage investments in advanced renewable fuels for aviation”. Unlike other sectors, aviation has currently no other alternative to liquid fuel. However, sustainable alternative fuels could provide up to 80% reduction in overall CO2 lifecycle emissions compared to fossil fuels. Mr Gill therefore stated that it is important that in the development and allocation of alternative fuels, special attention is given to aviation.



Luc Lallouette, Thalès SESAR Programme Director, reiterated that environmental protection in aviation is a top priority for industry. “In addition to a global measure and sustainable alternative fuels as crucial short to mid-term measures, efficiency improvements and technologies are the key drivers for the reduction of emissions” said Mr Lallouette. He added “thanks to the crucial contribution of EU aviation research programs such as CleanSky and SESAR, the aviation industry is on track to reach the ambitious objectives set by the Advisory Council for Aviation Research and Innovation in Europe (ACARE) Flightpath 2050: 75% reduction in CO2 per passenger km, 90% reduction Nox and 65% noise reduction, relative to the performance of a new aircraft in 2000”. ATM plays a very important role in addressing climate change by enabling greener and more efficient routes through a more integrated and digital airspace – which is crucial particularly in light of

the expected traffic growth. Together, CleanSky and SESAR constitute almost 50% of the efforts required to reach the ACARE goals with regard to CO2 emissions. Mr Lallouette therefore called on European policy makers to continue their efforts in this sector through successful research programmes. Following a number of interventions by among others MEPs Peter Liese, Julie Girling, Jacqueline Foster, Jakop Dalunde and Christian Ehler, Mrs Hohlmeier concluded by emphasing the European Parliament’s strong commitment towards environment and competitiveness in Europe. Mrs Hohlmeier also strongly advised the Member States that environmental taxes and fees (e.g. fuel and energy taxes) shoud be invested in research and environmental innovation programmes like CleanSky and SESAR.",air-traffic
"Thales has announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire the US company Guavus, a pioneer in real-time Big Data analytics. 



The acquisition of Guavus follows several acquisitions in the fields of connectivity, mobility and cyber security, and strengthens Thales's positioning in one of the key technologies at the heart of digital transformation, the processing and predictive analysis of “big data”, an increasingly critical factor in realtime decision-making. 



Patrice Caine, Thales’s Chairman and CEO, commented: “Combined with our established expertise in other key digital technologies, the acquisition of Guavus represents a tremendous accelerator of our digital strategy for the benefit of our customers. The application to Thales’s core businesses of Guavus's technologies and expertise in big data analytics will strengthen our ability to support the digital transformation of our customers, whether in aeronautics, space, rail signaling, defense or security.” 



Anukool Lakhina, founder and CEO of Guavus, added: “The opportunity to join Thales, a global high-tech giant, comes at a time when big data and their industrialised processing, especially in real time, play a key role in the digital transformation of governments, businesses and cities. All of Guavus's teams are enthusiastic about bringing more intelligent decision-making capabilities, at key moments, to Thales customers, while continuing to enrich our offering for our worldwide customers and partners.” 



Airlines, satellite, air traffic control, metro or train operators, armed forces or security officials of large urban or energy infrastructures rely on Thales’s high technology solutions to take the best decisions in real time. In a world facing exponential growth in the volume of data coming from increasingly connected sensors, Guavus’s acquisition opens broad opportunities for Thales in areas including predictive maintenance, cyber security, monitoring of critical infrastructures, network and telecommunication systems optimization. 



Guavus, a leader in real-time big data processing and analytics, is perfectly suited to the growing needs of an increasingly connected global ecosystem.

"Airways New Zealand is celebrating its 30th anniversary. The air navigation services provider (ANSP) was one of New Zealand’s first State Owned Enterprises and one of the first ANSPs to corporatise globally. Formerly the Civil Aviation Division of the Ministry of Transport, Airways started its new life as an SOE in April 1987.

“The move put Airways at the cutting edge of change and is something that many of our counterparts are only considering now,” CEO Ed Sims says. “Since then we have kept the skies safe and created a business success story for New Zealand.”

Minister for State Owned Enterprises Todd McClay says: “New Zealand is a small country surrounded by a lot of sea and air transport is vital to our economic growth. The Asia Pacific region in particular is experiencing significant traffic growth and Airways plays a critical role in making aviation is safe, efficient and sustainable.”

Airways is a high performing SOE, Mr McClay says. Over the past five years the organisation has nearly tripled its capital investment and quadrupled its profit, while customer charges are set to reduce by 4.7% over three years.

Airways provides services to domestic and international air traffic within New Zealand’s Flight Information Region (FIR) which totals 30 million square kilometres – one of the largest areas of sovereign airspace in the world. The organisation has also delivered training and consultancy services through its subsidiaries in over 65 countries.",air-traffic
"Air traffic controllers at Slovenia Control’s Ljubljana Area Control Centre have successfully handled shadow operations in Slovenian airspace using data processed remotely at EUROCONTROL’s Maastricht Upper Area Control Centre (MUAC) as part of the “ATM Data as a Service” (ADaaS) project.

“ATM Data as a Service” (ADaaS), a three-year project between Slovenia Control and EUROCONTROL’s MUAC, aims to develop and deploy a prototype to demonstrate that ATM data can be provided from an operational ATM environment as a service to one or more civil air traffic service units (ATSUs) by a single distributed ATM system. The project, which contributes to the Single European Sky by deploying new technologies and best practices, is co-financed by the European Union’s Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) to the tune of EUR 2.45 million.

In June 2016, Phase 1 of the joint project was successfully completed. The expert teams from both air navigation service providers were able within a limited time-period to overcome the operational and technical challenges inherent in such an innovative approach in the ATM environment. The next step, successfully completed in March 2017, was to demonstrate the use of an open interface between the MUAC flight data processing system and Slovenia Control’s controller working positions/human-machine interface. Data processed remotely at MUAC was displayed and used on three different types of controller working positions in the Slovenia Control simulator during the second phase of shadow operations. The human machine interface’s software and tools were adapted to communicate with the newly developed gateway, acting as a mediator and allowing an open interface by applying system-wide information management (SWIM) principles.

The final phase of the demonstration (Phase 3 of the ADaaS Demonstrator), planned for the third quarter of 2017, will involve a distributed flight data processing system in two locations (MUAC and Slovenia Control) and can serve controller working positions/human-machine interfaces either remotely or locally. Phase 3 will provide essential data on how to deploy a state-of-the-art data centre from which an ATM data service provider (ADSP) can deliver services to ATSUs with proper contingency and disaster recovery.",air-traffic
"The International Air Transport Association (IATA) released demand growth results for global air freight markets for February 2017 showing an 8.4% increase in demand measured in freight tonne kilometers (FTKs) compared to the same period last year. After adjusting for the impact of the leap year in 2016, demand increased by 12% -- almost four times better than the five-year average rate of 3.0%.

Freight capacity, measured in available freight tonne kilometers (AFTKs), shrank by 0.4% in February 2017.

The continued growth of air freight demand in 2017 is consistent with an uptick in world trade which corresponds with new global export orders remaining at elevated levels in March. Of particular note is the expanded volume of semi-conductor materials typically used in high-value consumer electronics.

""February further added to the cautious optimism building in air cargo markets. Demand grew by 12% in February—about four times the five-year average rate. With demand growing faster than capacity, yields got a boost. While there are signs of stronger world trade, concerns over the current protectionist rhetoric are still very real,"" said Alexandre de Juniac, IATA’s Director General and CEO.

The rapid growth of niche markets such as cross-border e-commerce and time and temperature sensitive pharmaceutical are showing robust growth as noted at the World Air Cargo Symposium held in Abu Dhabi last month. ""Any optimistic look at the future sees growing demand for specialized value added services. Shippers are telling us that the key to turning the current uptick in the cargo industry’s fortunes into longer-term growth is modernizing our antiquated processes. We must use the current momentum to push ahead with the elements of the e-cargo vision—including the e-air waybill which is nearing 50% market penetration,"" said de Juniac.

¹% of industry FTKs in 2016   ²Year-on-year change in load factor   ³Load factor level

All regions, with the exception of Latin America, reported an increase in demand in February 2017.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) announced global passenger traffic results for February showing a second month of strong demand growth to begin 2017.

Total revenue passenger kilometers (RPKs) rose 4.8%, compared to the same month last year. Although this was below growth achieved in January, year-to-year comparisons are distorted because February 2016 was a leap month. Adjusting for the one fewer day this year, the underlying growth rate was estimated at 8.6%, just under January’s increase of 8.9%. Monthly capacity (available seat kilometers or ASKs) increased by 2.7%, and load factor rose 1.6 percentage points to 79.5%, which was the highest ever recorded for February.

“The strong demand momentum from January has continued, supported by lower fares and a healthier economic backdrop. Although we remain concerned over the impact of any travel restrictions or closing of borders, we have not seen the attempted US ban on travel from six countries translate into an identifiable traffic trend. Overall travel demand continues to grow at a robust rate,” said Alexandre de Juniac, IATA’s Director General and CEO.

IATA estimates that allowing for inflation, the price of air travel has fallen by more than 10% in real terms over the past year, accounting for more than half the growth in RPKs in early 2017.

¹% of industry RPKs in 2016   ²Year-on-year change in load factor   ³Load factor level

February international passenger demand rose 5.8% compared to February 2016, which was down compared to the 9.1% yearly increase recorded in January. Adjusting for the leap year, however, growth actually accelerated slightly compared to January. Total capacity climbed 3.4%, and load factor rose 1.8 percentage points to 78.4%.

Domestic travel demand rose 3.3% in February compared to February 2016, reduced from 8.7% in January, but again, the leap year effect greatly exaggerated the slowdown. Results varied widely as Australia, Brazil and the US all registered non-adjusted declines. Domestic capacity climbed 1.6%, and load factor increased 1.3 percentage points to 81.4%.

¹% of industry RPKs in 2016   ²Year-on-year change in load factor   ³Load factor level  *Note: the seven domestic passenger markets for which broken-down data are available account for 30% of global total RPKs and approximately 82% of total domestic RPKs

The year has opened with some shocks—the attempted ban on travel to the US by citizens of six countries and the restrictions on the carry-on of large electronic items from certain airports in the Middle East and North Africa on direct flights to the US and the UK. The potential implications of the Brexit talks on the air transport industry are significant and the political rhetoric of protectionism and closing of borders is adding to the ambiguity.

""It’s intolerable that governments continue to add to the uncertainties facing the air transport industry by failing to engage airline operational know-how on issues that can damage public confidence. The introduction of restrictions on the carry-on of large electronic devices was a missed opportunity and the result was a measure that cannot stand-up to the scrutiny of public confidence in the long term. Although Australia’s measures were also implemented without consulting the industry, they at least demonstrate the potential to mitigate the threat with less disruptive means. We all want to keep flying secure. And we can do that most effectively by working together,"" said de Juniac.

In tandem, states need to support the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) as it develops a Global Aviation Security Plan. Additionally, next month, ICAO member states will consider amendments to Annex 17 of the Chicago Convention that would require information sharing. ""The security experience of recent years should compel states to support this,"" said de Juniac.",air-traffic
"The Central American Corporation for Air Navigation Services (COCESNA) has awarded Indra, a leading global consulting and technology Company, a contract to upgrade seven air traffic surveillance radars distributed in four countries and the Cayman Islands to provide them with cutting-edge digital features that allows a flexible maintenance and enhancement, optimizing costs.

This modernization improves quality of data and reliability of the service and allows the incorporation of updates in the radar network in a more flexible way.

The renewal will be addressed in radars operating in Monte Crudo and Dixon Hill in Honduras; Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands; Mata de Caña and Poas Volcano in Costa Rica; Puerto Cabezas in Nicaragua; and Cerro Santiago in Guatemala.

After the upgrade, radars will operate under the same conditions as the next-generation radars that are going to be installed in San Jose, Costa Rica, and Belize within the program for modernizing and standardizing COCESNA systems. Indra will also upgrade the systems that facilitate remote management of these radars to facilitate monitoring and maintaining them.

Digital reception technology makes it possible to apply advanced processing techniques of the pulse emitted and received by radars, making it possible to eliminate noise and increase the accuracy with which aircraft are detected. This means that air traffic controllers are able to 'see' better what happens in the airspace under their responsibility.

Indra will also incorporate ADS-B receivers in Mode S radars to reinforce the operation of radars. These systems are based on antennas that collect the information radiated automatically by aircraft reporting their position. By integrating the functions of the radar and the ADS-B, the results of the radar information are improved, increasing the probability of detecting and minimizing the cone of silence. This is all aimed to provide the best information to the air traffic controller and facilitate decision-making.

Indra has a consolidated relationship as COCESNA's technology provider. Currently, the entire upper airspace of Central America managed by this organization is ordered with Indra's technology and the company also supplies its systems to the countries that comprise it.

Indra is driving the modernization of air traffic management in Latin America. The company has been awarded the most important contracts of recent years in this region. Its systems are in operation in practically every Latin American country: it has modernized 70% of control centers in Latin America, 30 centers in total; it has installed its system in the majority of control towers; and, it has deployed close to fifty air traffic surveillance radars and a similar amount of radio navigation systems. In total, five hundred air traffic management systems of all types with the Indra seal are behind air traffic management in the subcontinent.",air-traffic

"The International Air Transport Association (IATA) asked the Canadian Government to improve the competitiveness of its aviation sector by prioritizing the elimination of Crown Rents over consideration of airport privatization.

""The Canadian government has already pocketed about C$5 billion as the historical landlord of airport property. That’s a C$5 billion disincentive to travel, to visit this wonderful country or to plan a business trip. Eliminating Crown Rents would boost Canada’s GDP by over C$300 million annually, create more than 4,000 jobs and generate an additional C$111 million in tax receipts. This should be the priority,"" said Alexandre de Juniac, IATA’s Director General and CEO.

The call to abandon Crown Rents was made in a speech to the Montreal Council on Foreign Relations in which de Juniac congratulated the Canadian government for not including airport privatization in its 22 March budget announcement.  ""We hope that Transport Minister Marc Garneau’s motivation to defend the interests of travelers will keep the privatization idea on the back-burner permanently. Let me be completely unambiguous. Canada will regret it if the crown jewels are sold,"" said de Juniac.

De Juniac elaborated on his concerns noting the industry’s disappointment with privatizations to date. ""We have not seen a regulatory framework anywhere in the world that has been able to successfully balance profit and public interest over the long-term. But we have seen airport privatizations dent a country’s competitiveness by increasing the costs of mobility and compromising service levels,"" said de Juniac.

""Airports should focus on enabling economic vibrancy in the communities they serve. That means providing sufficient capacity, with high service levels at affordable costs so that airlines can develop connectivity. Community owned airports—as is the case in Canada today—have every incentive to do so. Private companies, however, have a different goal which is to maximize profits for their shareholders,"" said de Juniac.

Aviation in Canada plays a key role in the economy—linking Canada to global markets and underpinning some 600,000 Canadian jobs. The government’s open dialogue in the Review of the Canada Transportation Act was a good example of the consultation with industry that is so critical to building a policy environment that supports growth and prosperity through competitiveness.

Consultation is the first step in building Smarter Regulation. IATA calls on governments to adopt Smarter Regulation principles so that regulations create value by efficiently solving real problems with minimal compliance costs.

""I hope that the Government’s openness to dialogue will point it towards Smarter Regulation principles on issues as diverse as passenger rights, tax levels, and infrastructure development,"" said de Juniac. In the same vein, IATA also urged Canada to find ways to remove the patchwork of provincial environmental measures impacting aviation to align with global efforts such as the Carbon Offset and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) recently agreed by governments through the leadership of the International Civil Aviation Organization.",air-traffic
"The International Air Transport Association (IATA) called on governments to urgently find alternatives to recently announced measures by the United States and the United Kingdom to restrict the carry-on of large electronic items on certain flights departing the Middle East and North Africa.

""The current measures are not an acceptable long-term solution to whatever threat they are trying to mitigate. Even in the short term it is difficult to understand their effectiveness. And the commercial distortions they create are severe. We call on governments to work with the industry to find a way to keep flying secure without separating passengers from their personal electronics,"" said Alexandre de Juniac, IATA’s Director General and CEO.

De Juniac made this demand in a speech to the Montreal Council on Foreign Relations in which he highlighted the need to maintain public confidence in the security of the global aviation industry which safely and security operates an average 100,000 flights a day.

""With the measures now in place, our passengers and member airlines are asking valid questions. Why don’t the US and the UK have a common list of airports? How can laptops be secure in the cabin on some flights and not others, including flights departing from the same airport? And surely there must be a way to screen electronic equipment effectively? The current situation is not acceptable and will not maintain the all-important confidence of the industry or of travelers. We must find a better way. And Governments must act quickly,"" said de Juniac.

IATA Calls for Better Coordination and Information Sharing

IATA also expressed frustration at the process used by governments to put in place the security measures which was woefully lacking. ""The industry came together quickly to implement the new requirements. That was a challenge because there was no prior consultation and little coordination by governments,"" said de Juniac.

IATA has long called for better information sharing and coordination on security measures among governments and with the industry.

""While governments have the primary responsibility for security, we share the priority of keeping passengers, crew and aircraft secure. To do that effectively intelligence is king. And it needs to be shared amongst governments and with the industry. It’s the only way to stop terrorists before they get near an airport, let alone aircraft,"" de Juniac.

Moreover, cooperation between industry and governments yields a better result. ""Airlines don’t want access to state secrets. But if airlines understand the outcome governments want, they can help with the operational experience to deliver that result effectively and efficiently,"" said de Juniac.

Challenges to aviation security were highlighted in Resolution 2309 of the UN Security Council which tasked the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to develop a Global Aviation Security Plan (GASeP). ""The need for such a plan has been made very clear by wide gaps in the measures taken by governments in recent days. States need to lend their full support to ICAO in developing GASeP quickly. And even before that can be achieved, there is an early opportunity to make a real improvement to international cooperation on security. In May ICAO member states will consider amendments to Annex 17 of the Chicago convention that would require information sharing. The security experience of recent years should compel States to support this,"" said de Juniac.",air-traffic
"Airservices Australia is today asking the general aviation industry to take part in a survey to help ensure a weather camera network is installed in locations that will deliver the greatest safety benefit.

Hosted on a public website, the network will provide access to an array of cameras that pilots can use to help view actual weather conditions at a variety of locations across Australia.

Aviation activist and entrepreneur Dick Smith donated $160,000 to Airservices in December 2016 to fund the network of weather cameras.

Airservices Chief Executive Officer Jason Harfield said Airservices has been working closely with the Bureau of Meteorology and airports to identify sites with existing power, communication infrastructure and cameras, using these to provide the new service.

“Once these sites have been identified, we will initially launch the website in May with six locations. The next phase of the project will focus on planning and delivering camera infrastructure to other locations as we continue to expand the weather camera network,” Mr Harfield said.

Airservices is urging the general aviation industry to complete the online survey, which opens today, to identify new locations that aviators would most value.

“By completing the survey, industry will assist Airservices to identify those locations that the aviation community feels would most benefit from up-to-date visual weather assessments.”

“The survey will be open until 30 April 2017.” Mr Harfield said.

Once the results of the survey have been collated, Airservices will provide further information on the final selection of locations and the schedule of the weather camera network roll out.

"On 7 March, 2017, the IHS Jane’s ATC award ceremony took place at the 2017 World ATM Congress in Madrid. Companies and projects across six categories were already shortlisted in January, 2017. Frequentis won the Technology Award, reflecting a significant contribution by the equipment and systems supplier, with its next-generation air traffic management network in Brazil, based on Software-Defined Networking.

Winners and shortlisted nominees for the awards have been recognised at a ceremony on 7 March. “We are very proud to win this fantastic award together with our customer, CISCEA (Commission for Implementation of the Brazilian Air Space Control System), and look forward to further implementing future IP-based ATM-grade networks. Thanks to CISCEA for trusting in our capabilities and thanks to IHS Jane’s for recognising this project as an important and outstanding one”, said Hannu Juurakko, Vice President ATM Civil at Frequentis, at the ceremony. 



The Brazilian Air Navigation Service Provider, DECEA, is responsible for the control of twenty-two million square kilometres of airspace, which is about twice the size of Europe. In order to support forecasted growth, change was required in its current network infrastructure. To meet the stated customer goals of higher network availability, increased reliability and improved safety, a solution has been created that supports ATM applications such as SWIM (System Wide Information Management) and Software-Defined Networking – allowing flexibility for dynamic resectorisation. 



The telecommunications infrastructure in vast areas of Brazil is a challenge, for many sites the last mile can only be established with extraordinary measures and in many cases only VSAT is available. The area is split over several network providers. “One of the current challenges we face related to unstable QoS (Quality of Service) of our telecoms infrastructure is brownout scenarios within the network. By deploying a Frequentis ATM-grade network with software-defined networking capabilities, we hope to substantially improve the way we deal with brownout scenarios in the future, thus achieving high availability and improved safety for our ATM and ATC systems, in a transparent way for final users”, Lieutenant Brigadier Aquino, General Director of DECEA summarised. “We are very proud of winning this award together with Frequentis.” 



The ATM-grade network delivered by Frequentis is a hybrid solution using conventional and softwaredefined network (SDN) elements. Providing application-aware network flows and use-case bandwidth optimisations, it converges different types of applications from safety-critical radio communication with administrative data traffic. In order to ensure time synchronised radio communication with high audio quality, ED-137 dynamic delay compensation over IP, VSAT and TDM-based WANs is also a part of the solution. DECEA will experience enhanced flexibility and capacity for Technical and Operational Management of the Brazilian Airspace Control System by implementing a National Network Operations Centre providing agile and secure processes.

"Representatives from five ANSPs signed a memorandum of cooperation during the World ATM Congress in Madrid aimed towards merging the two Free Route Airspaces SAXFRA (Slovenian Austrian Cross-Border Free Route Airspace) and SEAFRA (South-East Axis Free Route Airspace). 

 

SAXFRA (Austro Control and Slovenia Control) and SEAFRA (BHANSA, Croatia Control and SMATSA) are two crucial cross-border initiatives contributing significantly to the efficient flow of air traffic along the vital South-East Axis. Each project has shown itself to be working out very well, but in line with the goals of Single European Sky a merging of those two airspaces will generate even greater benefits. 

 

The South East Common Sky Initiative will strengthen the South East Axis by offering the shortest route options between Central and South Europe, including the flows to Turkey and further to the Middle East. This initiative not only works towards achieving the goals of the European Commission regarding the implementation of Free Route across Europe but also fulfils airspace users’ requests for having multiple route options available for the same city pair. The cooperation of SAXFRA and SEAFRA will produce one of the largest cross-border Free Route airspaces in Europe and is a significant step towards achieving a common European Free Route airspace (FRA) by 2022. 

 

“In line with the goals of Single European Sky this is the next significant step towards Free Route airspace across all of Europe. The South East Common Sky Initiative will benefit both the airlines and passengers in reducing fuel consumption as well as the travel time”, said Austro Control CEO Heinz Sommerbauer in Madrid. “If there is a common goal and willingness to cooperate, we can achieve great things. The South East Common Sky Initiative is a perfect example for that. Five ANSPs working together towards improving the flow of air traffic across Europe”, said Austro Control COO Thomas Hoffmann. 

 

“As a logical continuation of an excellent cross-border cooperation through the SAXFRA and SEAFRA free route projects, SECSI is not only in line with the Single European Sky initiative but offers even more increased efficiency and capacity over Central and South East Europe”, said BHANSA CEO, Davorin Primorac. 

 

“The SECSI Free Route airspace is a step forward after the two successfully completed FRA projects, SAXFRA and SEAFRA. I am sure that the five ANSPs will demonstrate excellent cooperation for the benefit of the airspace users to save thousands of tons of fuel per year;moreover, the citizens of the six states will be exposed to significantly decreased emissions of CO2 and NOx. I believe the airspace users will recognize the benefits of FRA in this region as well as the environmental achievements” said Croatia Control CEO Dragan Bilać.

“The South East Common Sky Initiative is another major step towards the needed ANSP collaboration in making a seamless European Sky a reality and reducing the future environmental footprint” said Slovenia Control CEO Franc Željko Županič.

"March 30- Speaking today before aviation leaders at the International Air Transport Association Wings of Change Conference at the first International Brazil Air Show (IBAS) in Rio de Janeiro, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acting Deputy Administrator Victoria Wassmer said that the United States is proud to participate in a partnership with Brazil which enhances bilateral cooperation on airport expansion, airspace management, aviation safety, and security.  Acting Deputy Administrator Wassmer is attending IBAS and participating inmeetings with government and industry leaders from Latin America and around the world.  “As traffic continues to increase between our countries, it is vital that operators are able to fly safely and seamlessly between our respective systems,” said Acting Deputy Administrator Wassmer. “By working together, the United States’ NextGen and Brazil’s Sirius programs are leading to safer, more efficient and environmentally friendly aviation systems in not only both countries but around the globe.”   The FAA and Brazil face many of the same issues to modernize air traffic management. These include the size of geographic area, civil-military coordination, vast spaces of remote airspace, congested terminal areas and a mature general aviation industry. Together, the United States and Brazil have collaborated through ICAO to achieve a modernized, seamless global air traffic management system. To complement those efforts, Acting Deputy Administrator Wassmer and Brigadier-Major Carlos Aquino, Director, General of the Department of Air Space Control (DECEA) yesterday signed an agreement for joint U.S.-Brazil to implement Ground Based Augmentation Systems (GBAS) research and development. GBAS is an alternative to the traditional Instrument Landing System (ILS) that is used to provide precision approach guidance down to the runway threshold at airports in near-zero visibility conditions.  Since 2013, the U.S.-Brazil Aviation Partnership has shared expertise through a series of workshops on airport design and construction, airport security, air traffic management, and airport certification. More than 1,200 aviation experts have participated.  Brazil has the world’s third largest aircraft manufacturer, Embraer S.A., and serves as a destination to more than seven percent of the annual outbound international traffic from theUnited States. Sirius is the new Brazilian Synchrotron Light Source which will be the country’s largest and most complex scientific infrastructure.

"Enav has been awarded by the Libyan Civil Aviation Authority a contract for the construction and set up of the control tower and technical building of the Mitiga airport in Libya. The new facilities will be equipped to guarantee the capability to provide all air navigation services and ensure the full operation and safety of the airport. The contract is worth 5 million euro and is expected to be completed by the end of 2017.

Mitiga airport, located 8 km from the Libyan capital Tripoli, is currently used to operate the domestic and international flights landing and taking off in the Libyan territory, due to the inaccessibility of the Tripoli airport. With the construction of the new control tower, Libya will benefit from the highest level of efficiency and safety of flight operations.

During the construction of the new facilities, Enav will temporarily supply the airport with an advanced mobile control tower equipped with state-of-the-art technology and workstations, which will allow air traffic controllers and technical staff to perform their activity in the best possible conditions.

In addition, Enav is currently providing training to 60 Libyan air traffic controllers under a contract signed last October. The project covers the training of operational staff who are required to maintain their qualifications in order to operate, after a long period of inactivity caused by the no fly zone in Libyan airspace.

The CEO Roberta Neri stated: “This important achievement is the result of the solid cooperation effort between all institutions involved, with a key role played by the officers and staff of the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, whom I wish to thank. It also confirms the excellent performance recorded in Enav’s commercial activities in 2016. Operating in Libya has a strategic importance for Enav, which goes beyond the economic value of the contract signed. The southern zone of the Italian airspace borders on the Libyan airspace, which is currently a no-fly zone. Encouraging the development of air transport and flights between Libya and Europe will allow us, in the future, to increase the traffic flows of interest for Italy and increase the revenue from regulated activities, thanks to the reinstatement of the routes that used to cross the Italian airspace before the no-fly zone over Libya was put in place.”",air-traffic
"On the 31st of March 2017 in Brussels, key actors[1] from the aviation sector (Airlines, Aircraft Manufacturers, National Aviation Authorities and Pilot Unions) agreed to join in a co-operative partnership named Data4Safety and initiated by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA).

The Data4Safety Programme aims at changing from the current reactive approach to safety – which is based on accident and occurrence reports – to a proactive approach, analysing trends and situations which can lead to a safety hazard. Stakeholders within the aviation community will share data, information and knowledge in order to deliver safety benefits.

Data4Safety will merge the very large and growing number of data sources available in the European aviation system and provide a critical mass of data.

"Leonardo is putting its innovative air traffic management solutions on show at World ATM Congress 2017 (Madrid, 7th - 9th March). Innovations comprise air traffic management (ATM) solutions for Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs) such as Free Route and two communications systems, which include the company’s Data Link and an airport surface data-link infrastructure and network solution, three new pillars on which the Single European Sky project is being built. The first two solutions are already employed by ENAV, the Italian air navigation service provider, which launched its Free Route operations in Italy on December 2016. The Free Route solution is just part of Leonardo’s LeadInSky, the company’s latest-generation ATM system, compliant with SESAR and the ICAO Aviation Systems Block Upgrades (ASBU) roadmap. Leonardo’s Free Route allows ANSPs to provide airlines with the planning of direct flight routes through ‘free route airspace’, helping the aircraft plot more efficient courses compared to the traditional air traffic services (ATS) route. This can reduce fuel consumption via shorter flight paths, saving costs and being more environment friendly. At the same time, safety and security levels are kept high, in line with the philosophy of the SESAR programme. Thanks to Leonardo’s solution, for every flight ENAV is able to offer above 11.000-metre free routes planning. 

 

Leonardo’s Data Link solution is a milestone in air traffic management; it allows users to move on from voice to digital text communication. This new system enhances security and efficiency by eliminating any possibility of misunderstanding between pilots and air traffic controllers. The Data Link system has been selected by ENAV, which has already implemented it at its Italy’s Brindisi Area control Centre as well as at 19 data transmission stations in Italy. Leonardo has also recently patented a further innovation, the ‘double squitter’, embedded in the Data Link. It allows for the integration and optimisation of the different telecommunications networks used by air navigation service providers and pilots and creates a single, integrated communication net. Leonardo’s Data Link infrastructure is also ready to support and manage civil-military interoperation as foreseen in the European ATM Master Plan Roadmap. 

 

Leonardo developed the airport surface data-link infrastructure and network solution that meets AeroMACS (Aeronautical Mobile Airport Communications System) standards, which is set to be an essential component of the implementation of data services. AeroMACS allows airport operators to rely on a secure communication network, which can support data exchange and ground operational needs. Leonardo’s solution provides a secure wireless data network gathering data from fixed or mobile resources, flight service vehicles and weather stations via a shared infrastructure. At WAC2017 Leonardo participates in the WiMAX Forum, a cross-industry meeting to share opportunities, challenges and strategies for this advanced type of network.

Leonardo is also ready to deploy its automated system for unmanned aircraft air traffic management, on show at the stand. Using new technologies, the system is able to efficiently and safely manage unmanned civil airborne traffic in very low-level urban airspace, up to 150 metres above the ground. The company has also developed a simulation environment, which can integrate Remotely Piloted Aircraft System operations into Air Traffic Management (ATM) scenarios for testing their full integration in real environment. 

 

At Leonardo’s stand, the company’s series 2100 Instrument Landing System (ILS), developed in cooperation with the Federal Aviation Administration, is on show alongside the firm’s new ADS-B radio for Wide Area Multilateration and ADS-B networks. Leonardo is also displaying its 5th generation ATC communications equipment, the OTE ARES (Air-ground Radio Equipment) for the Single European Sky. The new family of radios for ground-to-air civil communications uses a software-defined radio architecture. 

 

With leading experience in designing concepts for most complex and integrated systems of information and communication technology (ICT), Leonardo is delivering cyber protected products and solutions. ATM operators are facing challenges in protecting their increasingly interconnected networks from new and evolved threats. Current trends indicate higher complexity and targeting by threat actors. Leonardo offers embedded security solutions at delivery, together with a round-the clock support service via Security Operation Centre (SOC) at the customer’s premises or through remote services that Leonardo can provide using its internal SOC. During the Show, with the role of project leader, the company is also presenting a speech on GAMMA, a project, which addresses new threats to air traffic management and aims to develop solutions to emerging vulnerabilities. 

 

Leonardo has also been shortlisted for the Jane’s ATC Awards 2017, taking place during the Show (7th March), in the “Technology Award - reflecting a significant contribution by equipment and systems suppliers” category, for its comprehensive modernisation of ATM systems under Turkey’s SMART (Systematic Modernisation of ATM Resources in Turkey) project now underway, aiming to enhance the country’s ATC infrastructure and services.",air-traffic

PBN reduces the number of missed approaches thereby reducing fuel burn and CO2 emissions. The results from the 500 flight trials conducted by RISE partner airlines and Air Navigation Service Providers in France, Greece, Cyprus and Portugal are paving the way to wider implementation of Required Navigation Performance (RNP) in Europe. RISE also brought together a number of airlines who share common interests thereby demonstrating the benefits of deploying operational techniques in cooperation and helping to spread their uptake.

Multiple Remote Tower Operations - making remote air traffic control possible for more than one airport by a single controller

By the Irish Aviation Authority Multiple remote tower operations clearly shows that it is possible for a single air traffic controller to safely provide air traffic control services remotely to more than one low-volume airport. The initiative is a very good example of SESAR solutions, and has the potential to be replicated beyond the EU boundaries.  Remotely operated towers offer significant potential to assist air navigation service providers (ANSPs) to reduce and control their costs while maintaining safety and service delivery. This potential is greatest at smaller, less busy regional airports where the volume of traffic is likely to be insufficient to cover the costs of service provision at a user charge that is sustainable from the customers’ perspective.

"Oman's Public Authority for Civil Aviation already manages all the en-route flights in the country with the systems implemented by Indra in the new air-traffic control center in Muscat, which is now the largest and most advanced on the Arabian Peninsula.

The center will provide a capability for managing over twice the number of flights a year, and among other objectives, will support the Sultanate's plan to become a landmark tourist destination in the region. The precision offered by Indra's technology for planning aviation operations improves safety and punctuality and reduces costs. This will reinforce the attractiveness of the country's airport for use as an operations base or a major airline hub, thus generating more revenues.

The Public Authority for Civil Aviation now controls around 1,500 flights a day, a figure that could increase at a rate of 11% a year according to the organization's CEO, Mohammad bin Nasser Al Zaabi, at the inauguration of the new center. Oman's geographic location makes it an area of transit for many flights with destination or origin in other countries in the area and in Asia, so it is required to manage a very high volume of en-route traffic.

Indra has been working on the comprehensive modernization of Oman's air traffic control systems since 2010, when the company closed an ambitious 85 million euro contract for the modernization of the control centers and towers supporting the operations at the Muscat and Salalah international airports, the two most important. The project also contemplates the renovation of another three regional aerodromes under construction: Sohar, Ras Al Hadd and Duqm.

The project demanded the highest technical standards, and required implementing systems for automating traffic management, communications, aeronautic messaging, a weather information system and the implementation of aircraft guidance systems in the main airports. All this technology has transformed Oman into a reference in the region and places it on a par with the leading countries in the world.

For its part, in this period Indra has become one of the leading technology suppliers in the region, participating in key technology projects in the area, including the current deployment of a complete air defense system for Oman, the wholesale modernization of Kuwait's air traffic management systems, and the implementation of the systems for managing the high-speed train line that will link Medina and Mecca, to name just a few of the most important.",air-traffic
"The SESAR Optimised Descent Profiles (ODP) project was the winner in the Environment Category of IHS Jane’s ATC Awards, which were announced during the World ATM Congress in Madrid on 7 March. ODP was a joint project of European air navigation service providers (ANSPs) and airlines conducted under the leadership of the German ANSP DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung. Prof. Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, CEO of DFS, received the award on behalf of the consortium.

The aim of the project was to develop more efficient descent profiles and reduce the environmental impact in busy and complex airspaces and across borders without compromising safety and capacity aspects.

The optimum arrival is a continuous descent. In highly-frequented airspaces, which are shaped by national borders and handover points, this optimum is not always possible. Existing arrival flows can, however, often be improved. Instead of fixed waypoints, precise level windows can be defined and programmed in the flight management system of the aircraft. Another way of improving vertical flight efficiency is to remain at cruising altitude for a longer period of time before descending, since fuel consumption is lower at higher levels. The project also used flexible seasonal or runway dependent handover procedures.

Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, CEO of DFS, said: “Each and every descent profile optimisation counts and contributes to a more efficient and sustainable air transport in Europe. This award confirms the benefits achieved by the good collaboration between air navigation service providers and airlines for the sake of stakeholders, passengers and society as a whole.”

A total of 11,467 demonstration flights to nine airports in Europe were conducted. On an annual basis, these optimised flows have the potential to generate fuel savings of 3,400 tonnes, which equals more than 10,700 tonnes of CO2 emissions according to calculations by EUROCONTROL. Half of the 33 analysed flows have already been permanently implemented; seven are published in the Aeronautical Information Publication. Real savings achieved with the project’s demonstration flights amounting to 86 tonnes of fuel and a reduction of 270 tonnes of CO2 emissions.

Florian Guillermet, Executive Director of the SESAR Joint Undertaking remarked: ""The ODP project represented an excellent opportunity to demonstrate more widely the considerable savings in terms of fuel and emissions that are possible with optimised arrival flows. It is clear that procedures like these will be key to achieving a high performing aviation across Europe in the coming years.”

ODP was conducted in the framework of SESAR Integrated Flight Trial and Demonstration Activities and co-funded by the SESAR Joint Undertaking. It was conducted under the leadership of the DFS, together with the ANSPs of Austria (Austro Control), France (DSNA) and Switzerland (skyguide), as well as EUROCONTROL’s Maastricht Upper Area Control Centre (MUAC). Air France (plus HOP!), Deutsche Lufthansa (together with the affiliated Austrian Airlines and Germanwings) and Swiss International Airlines conducted the demonstration flights to the airports of Basel, Berlin Tegel, Frankfurt, Geneva, Munich, Strasbourg, Stuttgart, Vienna and Zurich.

By embedding Météo-France weather data into ECOsystem and leveraging the platform’s Air Traffic Flow Management (ATFM) application, ANSPs receive high accuracy prediction of severe weather activity en route and at airports, enabling severe weather mitigation to move from being reactive to proactive. The result is shorter avoidance routes; reduced fuel consumption and CO2 emissions; better adaptation of ATC sectorization plans and ATCO workload to actual airspace capacity; and better tuning of weather-induced regulations, resulting in reduced ground delays. Analysis performed during the SESAR TOPLINK Large Scale Demonstration estimated 1 million minutes of ground delay holding could be eliminated in Europe, delivering a potential cost benefit of up to 50 M€.

In addition to ANSP benefits, Airport operators will benefit from better anticipation of airport runway capacity reduction, as well as improved support to weather-dependent decisions, such as runway configuration changes or deicing needs.

Lastly, Airlines will benefit on the ground (flight dispatchers) and in the cockpit (pilots) as a result of anticipated flight management decisions in regard to severe weather avoidance.

This commercial partnership is an extension of joint Thales and MétéoFrance research activities conducted since 2011 for the TOPMET and TOPLINK SESAR projects.

“This partnership with THALES allows Météo-France to propose its forecasts on the globe to users of the whole world. Indeed with ECOsystem, all the aeronautical actors can benefit from meteorological information integrated into their tools.” Emmanuel Cloppet, Head of the sales management,  Météo -France

1. Leveraging more than 10 years of research and technology innovation, ECOsystem moved from concept to reality to enable ANSPs, airlines and airport operators to plan, monitor, manage and assess aviation operations for better decisions and better results. Through a suite of tools and predictive analytics, stakeholders optimize their operations, as well as contribute to global optimization through data sharing and collaborative applications. Further, ECOsystem is configurable to the customers’ operational requirements, from a global cloud-hosted service, to a local singlefacility deployment.",air-traffic

"Vienna Airport and Frequentis have signed a cooperation agreement to develop together a video-based smartVISION system to increase efficiency and enhance operational safety. The systems and knowledge developed from the partnership will be used for future research projects advancing the virtual tower concept.

In 2016, over 23.4 million passengers utilised Vienna Airport. Efficient operational processes and exceptional reliability are essential to ensure passengers reach their destinations on time. In order to optimise these processes, Vienna Airport and Frequentis have entered into a three-year technology and research partnership, and are now working together to develop a video-based apron overview system. This smartVISION solution will incorporate the airport's existing IT infrastructure. The IT hardware and camera system will be provided by the airport, and the software to set up and manage the system will be supplied by Frequentis.

A modern and efficient solution 

The goal is to use ‘stitching’ to piece together individual camera signals from ten cameras currently installed on the control tower. This will create a panoramic image, providing an overview of the entire apron at a single glance. Using pan/tilt/zoom cameras, it will be possible to obtain detailed images – for example of individual parking positions. It will also be possible to design more efficient working processes, thanks to a unified user interface displaying the panoramic image and associated information. Dynamic alarm fields and the integration of overlays and object tracking are also envisaged. These will help to enhance operational safety. Other features will be determined over the course of the research partnership. The system will be implemented in two stages, by the end of 2019 at the latest. 



""As a four-star airport, Vienna Airport is a byword for excellence. Punctuality, reliability and efficiency are absolutely vital to the day-to-day running of the airport, enabling 60,000 passengers to travel on time and in comfort. This means that all of our operational processes have to fit together seamlessly. Our collaboration with Frequentis will provide valuable insights in this regard,"" explains Julian Jäger, Chief Operating Officer of Flughafen Wien AG, who is very excited about the technology partnership.

Frequentis CEO Hannes Bardach adds: ""We are honoured to be part of this partnership. We will be able to utilise our product smartVISION, and draw on our extensive experience in the field of videobased surveillance from other projects. And together with the team from Flughafen Wien AG, we will be able to expand our expertise even further."" 



The collaboration has benefits for both partners: Vienna Airport will benefit from a modern, efficient solution for its operations, and Frequentis will be able to evaluate its smartVISION product readiness for use in future virtual tower projects. 



The technology partnership and the insights it yields will also serve as a basis for future research collaborations. In the context of SESAR - the programme for the modernisation and harmonisation of European air traffic management - the partnership will be an opportunity to evaluate and develop functionalities in the areas of ‘video-based surveillance’ and ‘safety nets’.",air-traffic

"At World ATM Congress 2017, Thales announces the launch of ECOsystem UTM, an advanced solution for Unmanned Aerial System Traffic Management (UTM), built with key technology from partner Unifly.

Joining forces to satisfy the growing need for UTM, the companies will leverage Thales’s unparalleled expertise in air traffic management, system integration and cyber security as well as Unifly’s dedicated focus on drone management to provide the premier UTM application. The solution will incorporate Unifly’s Validation Engine, a sophisticated software application that conducts real-time validation of drone flight plans, into Thales ECOsystem, a decision support platform for improved aviation operations.

Leveraging more than 10 years of research and technology innovation, ECOsystem1 moved from concept to reality to enable ANSPs, airlines and airport operators to plan, monitor, manage and assess aviation operations for better decisions and better results. Through a suite of tools and predictive analytics, stakeholders optimize their operations, as well as contribute to global optimization through data sharing and collaborative applications. Further, ECOsystem is configurable to the customers’ operational requirements, from a global cloud-hosted service, to a local single-facility deployment.

At last year’s World ATM Congress, Thales launched the first application of ECOsystem, Air Traffic Flow Management. This second application, UTM, integrates drone registration, pilot registration, flight planning, and regulatory/business rules with geospatial and meteorological information to enable adaptable workflows for managing drone operations as well as customizable situational awareness using tools such as map overlays, terrain views and 3D projections. The UTM application and data enable automated flight authorizations as well as real-time alerting and intervention in emergency situations. The application will support the rapidly growing demand for UAS operations in both Visual Line of Sight and Beyond Visual Line of Sight while ensuring the public’s safety, security and privacy.

“The number of drones is growing exponentially. Safely integrating such a large number of drones in the airspace is a challenge. This will require a UTM system that provides a high level of automation as well as a seamless integration into the world of ATM.  Thales and Unifly will collaborate to achieve just that.” Marc Kegelaers, Chief Executive Officer, Unifly

Unifly’s unique validation engine software uses geographically linked data to determine the safety of the intended flight. The Validation Engine is designed to process very large amounts of data. The validation occurs in real-time, both during the flight planning process as well as during the actual flight. Parameters include: position of the drone, airspace, local legislation, no-drone zones, geo-fenced areas, weather, obstacles, roads, as well as other manned and unmanned traffic.

Through working group and industry body participation, Thales and Unifly will team to support the aviation industry as it evolves to safely track and integrate UASs into the manned aviation domain. The companies will collaborate in pursuit of UTM business opportunities around the world.",air-traffic
"Defence and security company Saab has been selected to supply NATS, the United Kingdom’s leading provider of air traffic control services, with Wide Area Multilateration (WAM) equipment at two key sites in the UK.

Saab will be providing two WAM systems, the first will provide coverage of the East Shetland Basin oil fields and the main helicopter routes between Sumburgh Airport and the oil fields, and the second system will cover an area east of the windfarm being built offshore of Aberdeen.

"The public corporation responsible for maintaining Finland’s air navigation system has awarded a contract to Rohde & Schwarz to modernize its civilian air traffic control (ATC) ground radio communications system. Finavia’s country-wide project will transition ATC communications from analog radios to digital VoIP technology and keep Finavia among the leaders in civil aviation security, safety and operational efficiency.

Finavia is a public limited company wholly owned by the Finnish State. It maintains and develops a network of 21 airports and Finland’s air navigation system. Because their existing ground radio system, which is also from Rohde & Schwarz, was reaching the end of its lifecycle and European air traffic regulations now call for 8.33 kHz spacing, Finavia required a new system and turned once again to Rohde & Schwarz following a public tender process.

The contract comprises the modernization of the radio infrastructure at 69 radio sites across Finland. Installation of the 450 R&S Series4200 radios and 69 equipment racks is scheduled to begin in June 2017. Rohde & Schwarz will be responsible for delivery, installation and commissioning services.

The new R&S Series4200 VHF/UHF VoIP radios will provide high-quality voice connections between pilots and air traffic controllers. IP routing will improve resource management and provide more remote control features as well as fault tolerance. “We expect the project to proceed efficiently due to Rohde & Schwarz’s proven reputation for providing quality products, professional system integration and ongoing support,” says Finavia’s Vice President and Air Navigation Services Chief Technical Officer, Jukka Piilola. “We are pleased to have such an experienced partner as Rohde & Schwarz in this critical project.""

R&S Series4200 radios offer high operational safety and an extremely wide range of configurations, which permits optimal adaptation to any ATC application. This level of flexibility results from the radios’ software-based architecture and implementation. New functions can be implemented through software upgrades that Rohde & Schwarz will make available.

The DSiT software option, for example, is the industry’s first solution for the safety critical problem of undetected simultaneous transmissions (USiT). The new DSiT feature uses an innovative algorithm to detect the presence of simultaneous radio calls in the transmission channel. The air traffic controller is then notified that two calls have been received and can act accordingly.

Rohde & Schwarz will be exhibiting at the World ATM Congress 2017 in Madrid. From March 7 to 9, the company will showcase its comprehensive portfolio for state-of-the-art air traffic management at booth 586, hall 9.",air-traffic

"The Czech Republic’s air navigation service provider has appointed SITAONAIR to deliver a “communication gateway” to its capital’s airport.

 

 SITAONAIR will support air-to-ground data link applications to Prague Airport through its Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) network. The ambition is to extend this capability out to other Czech airports in the future.

 

 SITAONAIR’s communication gateway will provide a channel for Air Navigation Service of the Czech Republic (ANS CR) to send Digital Automatic Terminal Information Service (D-ATIS) and data link departure clearance (DCL) messages to aircraft.

 

 This will be equally beneficial to pilots and Air Traffic Control (ATC), replacing routine messages on congested voice frequencies with digital messages, to minimize the risk of misunderstanding. It will also reduce air traffic controllers’ and pilots’ workloads by ensuring ATC messages in the cockpit are displayed on screen, or printed in-cockpit. This will ensure that pilots won’t have to rely on interpreting bad quality voice messages.

François Bardin, Head of Air Traffic Service Solutions at SITAONAIR, said: “It is a source of pride to us that we have been chosen to deliver this project for the Czech Republic’s air navigation service provider.""

 

 ""Establishing this new communications gateway for ground-to-air data link applications, using our data link network, will not only greatly enhance our existing service for ANS CR, and the consistency and safety of controller-pilot communications, but offer complete end-to-end support.”

 

 Ivo Priplata, ATM/CNS expert, COM domain of Air Navigation Services of the Czech Republic, ANS CR, added: “SITAONAIR was an easy choice for us to deliver what will be a very important enhancement to our ground-to-air data link communications capabilities.""

 

 ""Nearly 800,000 aircraft movements in Czech airspace, including some 200,000 arrivals and departures, were handled by us in 2015 alone. The addition of SITAONAIR’s data link communications infrastructure will therefore be a very important evolution in reinforcing the flows of efficient, reliable and safe communications in Czech airspace.”",air-traffic
"G&D is presenting another new product at the World ATM Congress - the new DP1.2-MUX3-ATC. Via the KVM switch, ATCOs can operate up to three computers from one workspace (e.g. primary, redundancy and fall-back systems). The high-performance system supports 4K resolution at 60Hz and avoids the short image disturbances usually found at these resolutions when switching. The switcher is especially designed for the demands of ATC - 100% secure round-the-clock operation at top performance.

The new KVM Switch shows its strengths in ATC redundancy concepts. The compression-free system facilitates extremely fast switching. Redundancy and fall-back systems can easily be set up to run parallel to the primary system. In the case of computer malfunction, the user can switch to a redundancy system at the touch of a button - within a fraction of a second. As well as system security, the redundant system also offers the additional benefit that technicians can carry out administration and maintenance in the background without disrupting the work of the ATCO on the primary system. In combination with a KVM extender, the computer signals can be extended, so that pilot computers are blocked locally and operated remotely. Control rooms then enjoy optimal working conditions, without noise or heat emissions.

Using a KVM Switch, several systems can be easily operated from one workstation.. Controllers can be easily switched to a redundant system without any noticeable disruption to their work.

Especially designed for air traffic control, the KVM Switch boasts mission-critical features such as SNMP and monitoring for the active health management of system components, as well as redundant power supply. The user-friendly screen-freeze function holds its own in the case of a signal disruption. This feature ‘freezes’ the last received image in case the video signal fails. A semi-transparent red frame signifies this status. This means that the ATCO isn’t left looking at a black screen in case of emergency, rather has access to static information and a timer. Security concepts for automatic switching and external activation concepts are also available. These allow the system to be linked to further concepts to guarantee absolute reliability.

You can see the new KVM Switch from 07.03 to 09.03.2017 at G&D Stand 337 at the World ATM Congress.",air-traffic
"Free Route Airspace is steadily expanding. Now, aircraft operators can fly their preferred trajectories within the Bodø Oceanic FIR, where the Norwegian Air Navigation Services Provider Avinor is responsible for the air traffic management. This is yet another step in implementing FRA across large volumes of airspace. The next step will take place already in May 2017 when a continuous cross-border Free Route Airspace will be available across six North European states in NEFAB and Danish-Swedish FAB. This will enable airspace users to plan and fly the most cost effective, fuel efficient and timely routes with seamless FIR boundaries.

The implementation of Free Route Airspace (FRA) over large areas passed another milestone on March 2 when FRA was implemented within Bodø Oceanic FIR between FL 195 and FL660. This FRA volume adds to existing FRA areas in the North European Functional Airspace Block (NEFAB). The close cooperation between NEFAB and Danish-Swedish FAB in the NEFRA Programme has now resulted in a FRA stretching from the north eastern part of the ICAO NAT region to the boundary of the Russian Federation. The ultimate step in these common efforts will take place on 25 May 2017 when FRA in Norway will connect to the cross-border FRA already in operation between Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, and Sweden. In a cross-border FRA environment eligible flights are not required to enter a point on FIR boundaries in their flight plan, thereby increasing the flexibility in flight planning for optimized flight trajectories.

Free Route Airspace in Bodø Oceanic is just one step from completing the NEFRA programme in May 2017 and a step closer to seeing continuous cross-border FRA across Northern Europe by 2021 in the Borealis Alliance Free Route Airspace programme, pursued by nine air navigation service providers.",air-traffic
"Aireon announced today that they have formally received control from Iridium Communications Inc. (NASDAQ:IRDM) of the first Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) payload hosted on an Iridium NEXT satellite. This is a major milestone on the path towards 100 percent global air traffic surveillance. Aireon now begins a rigorous, in-depth testing and validation process, verifying the capability of the ADS-B payloads. 



Known as an Initial Performance Verification (IPV), this process will last approximately two weeks before transitioning to a Detailed Performance Verification (DPV) that will focus more specifically on calibrating the payloads for optimal performance. Procedures for the IPV were under development for over a year with valuable insight provided by Iridium, Harris Corporation, NAV CANADA and the Federal Aviation Administration. 



“When we first turned on the payloads after they reached orbit, we received an unexpected surprise – aircraft were immediately being seen in real-time,” said Aireon CEO, Don Thoma. “We’ve already seen commercial aircraft, general aviation aircraft and helicopters, in oceanic and remote airspace that have never before had real-time surveillance. The real fun for us now begins as we take control and push the performance to see just what space-based ADS-B can do.” 



In late January, the first “power-on” for the AireonSM ADS-B payload was performed to validate launch survival and run a self-diagnostic systems check. During this systems check, Aireon did not expect to see any aircraft, however the payload antennas were active and 150 ADS-B aircraft were detected over multiple-passes with thousands of ADS-B messages received and decoded. Among some of the firsts for the Aireon system are: 







“Detecting NextJet 594 was an added bonus,” said Vincent Capezzuto, CTO for Aireon. “This is an early proof-point of the power of the Aireon ADS-B payload and its ability to detect aircraft close to the ground and in terminal airspace.”

Aireon’s space-based ADS-B system will be operational in 2018, shortly after completion of the Iridium NEXT satellite constellation. The service will provide Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs) with global air traffic surveillance and airlines with real-time flight tracking. It is expected to help reduce fuel costs, increase safety, and enable more efficient flight paths. The first 10 Iridium NEXT satellites carrying the Aireon hosted-payloads were launched into low-Earth-orbit from Vandenberg Air Force Base on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, on January 14, 2017.

Seven additional SpaceX launches are scheduled to take place over the next 12 to 15 months, including the second launch now targeted for mid-June 2017. In total, the operational constellation consists of 66 satellites, while the remaining nine launched will serve as on-orbit spares.",air-traffic
"Atech, a Brazilian company of the Embraer Group, is taking part of the debates about technological advances in the field of air traffic control at the World ATM Congress in Madrid, Spain, from March 7 to 9. At the event, Atech will present ATM solutions implemented in Brazil—which cover 100% of the country—and are responsible for the country’s air traffic management and air defense, as well as for the flow management system integrating all flight data of Brazilian airports. For this edition of the World ATM, another highlight introduced by the Brazilian company is a new simulation solution for qualifying flight controllers, recently developed in partnership with the Brazilian Air Force (FAB).

In the field of management of air traffic control, Atech showcases SAGITARIO, also developed in partnership with the Brazilian Air Force, which marks the evolution of the air control system in Brazil as it employs an innovative communication, navigation and surveillance solution for the command and control of the Brazilian airspace. The concept of SAGITARIO focuses on providing complete control before takeoff until the parking of the aircraft at its destination airport, with the use of its systems installed in the airport’s control tower, approximation center and control center in the area, thus ensuring that all each stage is performed in a safe and efficient manner within the established international standards.

To work in concert with SAGITARIO, Atech has also developed SIGMA (Integrated System for Air Movement Management), a system that integrates data of air companies, airports and control organizations, among others, providing useful meteorological information for the management of air traffic control in one single database. With this integration, the system allows the flow management center to balance air traffic capacity and demand in order to ensure the safety of operations, as well as regular and timely flights. SIGMA currently operates in the Air Navigation Management Center (CGNA), in Rio de Janeiro, working continuously to ensure the balance between the service capacity of the Control System of the Brazilian Airspace (SISCEAB) and the demand of air movements. SIGMA was an important ally of the Brazilian authorities for successfully managing air traffic during the 2014 FIFA World Cup and the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio.

This background enabled Atech to join the select group of Brazilian companies exporting high-tech solutions such as Skyflow, acquired by the Airports Authority of India (AAI) and already in operation in that country. Skyflow is the commercial version of SIGMA, having been adapted to the requirements of air traffic flow management specific to the Indian subcontinent.

Aiming to provide complete and integrated solutions, Atech has also developed a simulation system of airspace control PLATAO (Advanced Platform for Training and Operational Updating) designed to qualify and update the knowledge and abilities of air traffic controllers. This training platform allows the rendering of complex scenarios such as communication via the linking of data between the air controller and the pilot, and the scanning of aircrafts through new technologies. In the case of the solution developed by Atech, PLATAO creates drills simulating simultaneously more than one control center operational scenario. The system’s architecture features a pioneering take on Data Distribution Service (DDS) concepts for use in real time, according to the specifications of the Object Management Group (OMG). The system hence offers processes of data access and sharing, as well as system performance, safety, portability and scalability.",air-traffic

"At World ATM Congress 2017, Thales, world leader in Air Traffic Management, and SITAONAIR, the air travel industry’s trusted connected aircraft service expert, signed an agreement to develop and promote ATC data link solutions. This agreement continues their long-standing collaboration on data link solutions. Data link is one of the key axes of the connectivity curve, which all operators in the ATM field agree will be a revolution in the market.

Data link enables pilots, controllers and towers to share and send information though connected cockpit and ATC systems. By having the ATC systems communicate directly with the avionics, controllers and pilots will no longer need to rely on voice-only communications, but will be able to share exact data, inputted directly in their systems, reducing the time between a command being given and actioned, the number of human errors and the workload during the most stressful portions of the mission (take-off and landing).

The agreement reiterates Thales’s and SITAONAIR’s commitment on the joint Data Link Front-End Processor (DL-FEP) solution being developed to address the data link services rule of the Single European Sky programme. The DL-FEP consists of Context Management and Controller Pilot Data Link Communications (CPDLC) applications associated with ATC automation systems.1 The DL-FEP product is already providing or will soon be providing operational Data Link services for EUROCONTROL MUAC2, US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Deutsche Flugsicherung (DFS), skyguide and UK NATS. Additionally, the DL-FEP is currently being enhanced to support the SESAR 2020 I4D Very Large Scale Demonstrations.

The agreement also covers joint promotion and marketing of Thales ProATN products to air navigation service providers. The ProATN product line includes ATN3 Air-to-Ground routers, Ground-to-Ground routers and associated tools that support the routing of data link messages among software applications and air-to-ground radio sites to facilitate communication of messages between users. ProATN is the most widely used ATN router supporting the SITAONAIR AIRCOM® ATN Service since 2004 as well as nearly all major ANSP ATN ground infrastructures. Almost all ATN CPDLC messages cross at least one ProATN router during transmission.

“We are pleased to be reiterating our commitment to delivering data link solutions of the future with our partner Thales. The development of our joint DL-FEP product, by responding to the European Commission’s mandate, represents an essential step towards the realization of the Single European Sky.” François Bardin, Head of Air Traffic Service Solutions, SITAONAIR",air-traffic
"The International Air Transport Association (IATA) announced global passenger traffic results for January 2017 showing demand (revenue passenger kilometers or RPKs) rose 9.6% compared to January 2016. This was the strongest increase in more than five years. Results were positively affected by traffic associated with the Lunar New Year celebrations, which occurred in January this year, compared to February in 2016. IATA estimates the holiday-related travel contributed up to one-half a percentage point in extra demand growth. January capacity rose 8.0%, and load factor climbed 1.2 percentage points to 80.2%.

""2017 is off to a very strong start, with demand at levels not seen since 2011.

"A consortium led by IAOPA Europe and aviation consultants Helios has applied for EU funds to offset the costs of upgrading equipment to meet new rules on 8.33kHz channel spacing - and they are calling on General Aviation (GA) users and aerodromes to pre-register now to obtain refunds where applicable.

Expansion of the voice channels available helps relieve congestion in the VHF band as mandated by SESAR – Single European Sky. Upper airspace has already been addressed and regulatory attention is now switching to lower airspace below FL195, commonly used by the GA community. The new regulations will affect all radios operating in the 117.975-137MHz band (the VHF band) - both airborne and ground based - and come into force from 31st December 2017 also for VFR.

If the consortium's application is successful, a refund of at least 20% will ease the financial burden for all general aviation aircraft and aerodromes in no less than 19 countries with the expected upgrades needed costing up to 147 million Euro. The countries covered are: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden and Switzerland.

Commenting on the initiative, Dr Michael Erb, Senior Vice President IAOPA (Europe) said: “New 8.33 radios in certified aircraft cost an average of around €5,000. So, it’s definitely worth making a claim. We’ve applied for almost €37 million in grant funding, which would support the upgrade costs for over 26,000 airframes.”

Philip Church, Helios’ project director noted: “The timescales for the mandate are tight and the period to admit claims will be short. To increase the chance of getting a partial reimbursement of your costs we recommend that owners sign up right away and actively plan on equipping within the project timescales. It is a very simple registration procedure and you do not need to submit any documentation at this stage.”

IAOPA Europe invites all GA aerodromes, aircraft owners, pilots and AeroClubs of all aircraft registered or owners based within the participating countries to find out more and pre-register at their dedicated website http://833.iaopa.eu. The refunds will be available for upgrades of radio equipment after February 7, 2017 on a “first come, first served” basis.",air-traffic

"Jersey Airport is set to become the first provider of Remote Tower Service technology in the British Isles following a major development programme with leading aviation specialists, Systems Interface Ltd and Searidge Technologies (Canada).  Certisa Ltd will be providing the Safety Assurance elements of this project.

 

 Remote Tower Service Technology is the ability to perform usual air traffic services from an alternative location away from the usual airport control tower.   Currently, the only certified remote tower operation in Europe is in Sweden.

The decision by Ports of Jersey to implement this technology was driven by its wish to increase its capability of continuing to provide air traffic services in the event of a catastrophic technical failure of equipment or the need to evacuate the main Air Traffic Control facility at Jersey Airport. This means that the Visual Control Room and Approach Facility can still be operated from a remote location, allowing aircraft to continue to operate in and out of Jersey Airport and Channel Islands Airspace.

The system itself consists of a display feature showing a 220 degree view of the airfield, emulating the view that air traffic officers see from their control tower. The system also boasts two zoom cameras, which allows for a detailed close up views of aircraft both on the ground and in the air.



Senior Air Traffic Control Officer at Jersey Airport, Les Smallwood, is confident that such technology will be of great benefit to the Island and explains, “This solution will provide guaranteed resilience in the event of equipment failure or the need to evacuate the main ATC facility at the airport.  Additionally, we hope that being at the forefront of this technology will enable Ports of Jersey to expand its business portfolio in this area”.

The initiative, which is costing Ports of Jersey £1.3m is being launched at the World ATM Congress in early March 2017, being held in the Spanish City of Madrid. This 3-day show attracts aviation specialists from around the world, including air traffic management experts, leading product developers and service providers. Representatives from Ports of Jersey will attend the congress, partnering up with Searidge Technologies (Canada) to promote the technology.

Mr Smallwood continues, “By attending this prestigious show it will launch the Jersey Airport project on to the world stage, indicating that we are committed to developing this technology and cementing our position as a credible ATC organisation”.

Group CEO for ports of Jersey, Doug Bannister concludes “The air traffic management sector is changing rapidly, with a convergence of technology, process and expertise.  Ports of Jersey, working with strong technology partners and advanced regulators, are firmly at the leading edge of these developments. This is an exciting period indeed.""",air-traffic

"The Civil Air Navigation Services Organisation (CANSO) has launched a new initiative to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from air traffic management facilities. The new CANSO publication, Air Navigation Service Provider Carbon Footprinting: A Best Practice Guide, helps air navigation service providers (ANSP) measure, monitor and improve their environmental performance on the ground.

Launching the new guide, CANSO Director General, Jeff Poole, said: “CANSO Members take their environmental and social responsibilities very seriously. The air traffic management (ATM) industry is already playing a vital role in reducing aircraft emissions through more efficient operations. ANSPs can also reduce emissions more directly by managing the environmental impact of operating the facilities they own and manage. This guide gives ANSPs the tools to do that and I encourage all ANSPs to measure their carbon emissions as a crucial first step in identifying and delivering environmental improvements.”

The aim of the guide is to provide ANSPS with a framework to establish tailored programmes to measure, monitor and reduce emissions from their ground-based facilities. It focuses mainly on the management of ‘estate’ related carbon impacts, such as emissions from powering ANSP buildings and the infrastructure associated with delivering ANSP operations and services. The guide is based on best practice by ANSPs that have well-established carbon footprinting programmes and includes case studies of how some ANSPs are significantly reducing their emissions.

The new initiative is part of the ATM industry’s successful efforts to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions from aviation. CANSO plays a full part in the aviation industry’s four-pillar strategy to reduce aviation’s climate impact: investing in new technology; improving operational performance; developing more efficient infrastructure; and market based measures. CANSO and its Members continue to focus on pillar two – improving the efficiency of aircraft operations; and pillar three – improving aviation infrastructure.  The ATM industry is helping to implement pillar two through procedures that enable aircraft to fly shorter, optimum routes and take-off and land with smoother trajectories, thus reducing emissions. For pillar three, we are working with States to modernise and upgrade their ATM systems to increase capacity and reduce delays, thus reducing emissions, increasing efficiency and ensuring a smoother experience for passengers.

"Few workplaces have higher standards or more stringent regulations than the ATC control room. With human life at stake, it’s no place to cut corners or make any kind of error. For the ATCOs who work there, it is a highly strenuous job requiring the highest levels of concentration with multi-tasking skills. Therefore perfect working conditions are an absolute necessity. To work effectively, ATCOs need accurate information – e.g. if trajectories on a radar screen are crossing on different levels, displayed in different colours to indicate different parameters, this visual information needs to be crystal clear and absolutely reliable.

The work in the control room involves constantly staring at a computer screen which can be detrimental to health. First of all the heat and noise generated by the computers themselves can be stressful and a distraction. KVM systems can solve this issue by moving computers out of the control room whilst ensuring remote operation in real-time. Another health aspect is the Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS) with its symptoms of headaches, blurred vision, neck pain and eye strain underlines the need for providing the highest levels of video quality. So if using a KVM system this maximum level of video quality has to be ensured.

An uncompressed ideal

KVM systems allow computers to be moved out of the ATC control room and into a dedicated technical centre whilst ensuring remote operation in real-time. With computers out of the control room, noise and heat follow along with the computer maintenance engineers. There’s more safety too as KVM is custom-made for redundancy concepts.

There is a choice of systems available and the major difference lies in the video transmission. Some systems transmit the available information pixel-by-pixel and in real-time – this is called an uncompressed transmission. In use, these KVM systems operate between the computer and the workplace and act “transparently”- what comes in is what goes out. This is because uncompressed systems provide the high bandwidth necessary to forward the entire incoming video from the computer’s graphics adaptor to the display. The transmission is pixel-by-pixel perfect, transparent, uncompressed and absolutely lossless. However, the higher the video resolution, the more bandwidth is required so more demand is placed on the transmission system, making it more costly. Therefore the result is absolutely reliable and at the maximum quality. The ATCO does get to see every any single pixel that the computer system can provide.

The legal component

The highest video quality is also an essential for the majority of ANSPs that record ATC communications. If an issue should occur, this recorded material is used as a clarification of events. But for a true “recording at the glass” the recorded quality has to correspond exactly with what the ATCO has seen, so it does not become questionable as evidence. When recording takes place remotely in the technical area but the video displayed at the CWP is transmitted via a KVM system - only uncompressed systems guarantee the reliability for referential integrity.

Is compression a viable choice?

Depending on the application and on the quality achieved, video compression has many advantages. First among these is lower bandwidth which in turn allows for lower spec (and cheaper) components and easier ways of further handling the signals, especially via matrix systems. Matrix systems allow complex switching of the signals. Many computers and consoles are connected to a central matrix switch which allows cross-wise access. This can be seen as kind of a bottleneck as the switch has to handle all the video and further signal streams at a time. But with the lower bandwidth of compressed video, such bottlenecks can be solved – whilst taking into account a slightly reduced video quality.

At G&D, along with our uncompressed KVM solutions we’ve also developed systems using our own compression algorithm. Working with G&D High Dynamic Image Processing Level 3, these also provide a pixel perfect video result and are suitable for ATC use, too. However, compressed or uncompressed, all of our systems are thoroughly tested and produced according to ISO 9001 standard, which is supported by decades of experience providing installations for the ATC sector. Yet for compressed systems we have to admit: what commonly is called visually lossless – the term itself already implies it – contains certain losses though.

Is it worth it?

The primary reason for choosing a compressed system over an uncompressed one is cost. The question is, should cost be a factor in the critical environment of the ATC control room? When human life is at risk not to mention the health and careers of those who work in such an environment, the slightest cut in quality, efficiency or standards becomes very difficult to justify. There is a difference between compressed and uncompressed video. The risk may be minimal with compressed and for sure the financial costs are less but it only takes one mistake for a severe incident to occur. The cost of that could be incalculable in financial and human terms too. So if you really have no alternative and an uncompressed system is beyond your budget, make sure you go for the very best compressed system available!",air-traffic
"Airways New Zealand, New Zealand’s Air Navigation Service Provider (ANSP) and Aireon LLC announced today that they have signed an agreement in principle to enter into an operational validation trial.

This agreement will pave the way to a formal operational validation agreement allowing for the development of operational concepts for air traffic management in South Pacific airspace and long-range flow management procedures to major New Zealand destinations. These operational concepts will be based on the use of space-based Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data to leverage the efficiency and safety benefits of a global air traffic surveillance capability.

This agreement comes 20 months after the execution of a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between Aireon and Airways to execute a benefits analysis for deploying space-based ADS-B in their region. Airways also plans to use Aireon data to determine the best configuration of planned terrestrial-based ADSB installations, augmented with space-based ADS-B, to ensure the most cost-effective use of the designated infrastructure.

Airways chief executive officer Ed Sims says Airways is excited to be exploring the possibilities of this new capability. “Once we have completed the formal agreement we will, over the next three years, work with Aireon to investigate how satellite-based surveillance could enhance our air traffic management services in the South Pacific airspace.

“We are looking forward to seeing how continuous monitoring via satellite could provide enhanced safety, traffic flow and efficiency benefits to our customers.”

“We are very excited about the developments with Airways,” said Don Thoma, chief executive officer, Aireon. “We have worked closely with Airways to determine the possible applicability of space-based ADSB in the South Pacific.” He added, “Airways is known for their strong desire to deliver value to their customers, and we look forward to taking the next step to assess the potential for deployment of spacebased ADS-B in their region.”

Aireon’s system will be operational in 2018, upon completion of the Iridium NEXT satellite constellation. The service will provide ANSPs with global air traffic surveillance and airlines with real-time flight tracking. It is expected to help reduce fuel costs, increase safety, and enable more efficient flight paths.",air-traffic
"A group of industry players have come together to launch a debate about how the efficiency and performance of air traffic management (ATM) could be improved through greater market liberalisation.

Founded by the Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs) of New Zealand, the UK, Ireland and the Czech Republic and in partnership with the Civil Air Navigation Services Organisation (CANSO), the ATM Policy Institute will provide research on ATM policy issues and make the case for the benefits of enabling ANSPs to compete with each other for the provision of ATM services.

The Institute is chaired by David McMillan, a former Director General of Eurocontrol and, prior to that, the Director General of Civil Aviation in the UK’s Department for Transport.

“Liberalisation revolutionised the airline industry and has been a global success story, driving growth across the world”, comments David McMillan. “Unfortunately, air traffic management remains largely a national monopoly, without the incentives necessary to drive up performance. We believe that by opening up parts of the ATM industry to greater liberalisation significant benefits could be achieved, including reducing costs and minimising the environmental impact of aviation, all while maintaining or improving on today’s safety levels”.

While there is currently very limited competition within the ATM industry, in cases where competition has been introduced, the benefits are already evident. For example, in Spain, changes in the provider of Terminal Air Navigation Services as a result of a competitive tender are estimated to have resulted in cost savings of around 50%, while in Sweden savings of 30-40% have been reported.[1]

“We are looking forward to working with airlines, regulators and other stakeholders, including, importantly the staff of ANSPs.” McMillan noted.  “For too long there has been no focal point for the work that is being done on these topics around the world.  The benefits to airlines and their passengers of taking advantage of this thinking are clear.”

The Institute has launched a paper The case for liberalising Air Traffic Control setting out the benefits of liberalising the ATM industry as well as outlining a vision of what competition in ATM would look like.

The paper argues that the ATM industry is currently under-performing, in large part due to the absence of competition to incentivise performance. It argues that competition could generate significant benefits for customers, including creating strong incentives for ANSPs to improve their cost efficiency and operations in order to compete on price, without compromising safety.

David McMillan added: “It’s time we look for new ways to meet the capacity, cost and environmental challenges facing our industry. New thinking is required and we hope we can prompt policy-makers around the world to think differently about how to improve ATM performance and meet the future challenges facing the industry.”",air-traffic
"NATS has selected the R&S VCS-4G IP-based voice communications system from Rohde & Schwarz as its second voice system for its air traffic control (ATC) communications in UK airspace. The voice over IP (VoIP) COTS solution from the Munich-based electronics firm was chosen based on its reliability, innovation and flexibility to create a single platform across NATS’ Swanwick and Prestwick control centers. In addition, the company has agreed to an accelerated delivery schedule to support NATS in their “Deploying SESAR” transformation programme.

Rohde & Schwarz will provide the British air traffic service provider NATS with the IP-based voice communications system R&S VCS-4G. Within the framework of the Single European Sky (SES) initiative, NATS will modernize its entire air traffic management (ATM) infrastructure over the next few years. Tim Bullock, Director Supply Chain Management at NATS, explains: ""NATS controls more than 2.4 million flights every year. Our systems must be both flexible and able to handle heavy workloads in order to ensure efficient operations for airlines and passengers alike. We have found in Rohde & Schwarz an innovative and reliable partner. We welcome them to the collaborative team of suppliers joining us on our ATM transformation journey towards SESAR deployment.”

Rohde & Schwarz will begin the implementation of the second voice system in 2017. It will provide enhanced resilience for voice based radio communications in UK airspace. The air traffic control centers in Swanwick and Prestwick as well as the NATS corporate and technical centre in Whiteley will all be equipped in a phased deployment that will be completed by 2020. The order includes the delivery, implementation and through-life support of more than 450 R&S VCS-4G controller working positions (CWP). Up to 1700 radios and various ground-ground lines will be connected to the system.

According to Bosco Novak, Executive Vice President Secure Communications Division at Rohde & Schwarz: ""NATS is a forerunner in the deployment of SESAR and introducing new technologies. It will be the first air traffic control provider in Europe to completely migrate all of its ATC communications to IP. Deploying our technology as the second voice system will increase service resilience and add operational flexibility to NATS business operation.""

As airspace becomes more crowded, there is an increased demand for flexible, load-based reallocation of resources while ensuring efficient and sustainable air traffic control in line with the highest safety standards. Rohde & Schwarz is a proven provider on the market offering the ability to create virtual control centres. The electronics firm meets this challenge with the R&S VCS-4G IP based voice communications system. The fully VoIP-based system in line with the EUROCAE ED-137 B standard features a distributed, redundant architecture. It will link the control centres in Swanwick and Prestwick and provide the geographic flexibility to manage their operations as one operational environment in the future.

"The International Air Transport Association (IATA) set out an agenda for a stronger, safer, more secure and sustainable European aviation industry.

Alexandre de Juniac, IATA’s Director General and CEO, in an address to the European Aviation Club entitled Charting the Right Course for Aviation in Europe, called on European policy-makers to prioritize four areas:

""Air transport plays a vital role linking Europe together with the rest of the world. In the EU, 8.8 million jobs are linked to aviation, as is EUR 620 billion in GDP. Some 650 million passengers a year rely on aviation to get them where they need to be. So it is vital that we work together to chart the right course for its future.

For airlines, Europe is not an easy or cost-efficient place to do business. As global competition further intensifies it is only going to get more challenging—potentially costing European jobs, hindering European growth and reducing the European quality of life,"" said de Juniac.

De Juniac also had a message for global policy makers on the role of aviation as a catalyst for economic and social development.

""Aviation is the business of freedom. Air travel liberates people to live better lives and makes our world a better place. The current political rhetoric is deeply concerning. It points to a future of restricted borders and protectionism. We see it in travel bans, border walls and trade agreements that are being called into question.

Durable peace, prosperity or security have never been achieved through provocation, exclusion and division. The world has grown wealthier with people traveling and trading. That has helped to lift over a billion people from poverty. Aviation is proud of the role it plays in making this happen. Ensuring aviation’s power to connect people has never been more important,"" said de Juniac.",air-traffic
"The Civil Air Navigation Services Organisation (CANSO), representing Europe’s air navigation service providers (ANSP), has agreed to work together constructively with A4E to enhance the performance of Europe’s air traffic management (ATM) network in the future.

The first goal of this cooperation is to discuss and gain a common understanding of the technical, operational, regulatory and legal issues that exist today related to industrial action in the European ATM network. In six months, both organisations will evaluate progress in addressing these issues that affect the whole of Europe.

CANSO and A4E recognise that, where measures to help minimise the impact of industrial action on passengers are not already in place, for example a compulsory minimum of 72 hours notification of participation in a strike, these should be implemented by European States where possible and practical.

In addition, CANSO and A4E welcome the intention of the European Commission to make recommendations to European governments building on the existing efforts of both CANSO and A4E.

""CANSO is ready to engage in a collaborative and productive relationship that achieves the objectives of a reliable air transport system, enabling passengers and businesses to enjoy the full benefits of free movement by air in Europe. CANSO recognises the right to strike of European citizens and, while we would have preferred a different tone and approach to the A4E campaign, we fully recognise that industrial action in some countries has had a significant impact on airline operations over the past few years.  CANSO Members share our customers’ determination to reduce any disruption to the travelling public and deliver real benefits to consumers. CANSO Members have worked hard to establish a well-defined culture of consultation and negotiation in cases where there are diverging opinions and potential for industrial action to occur.  As a result, most ANSPs and their social partners have successfully avoided industrial action or managed the action to reduce the impact on the travelling public"", said Martin Rolfe, CEO NATS and Chair of CANSO Europe.

“CANSO and its Members are key to maintaining a reliable air transport network in Europe.  We welcome the clear position they are taking and appreciate that a large majority of ANSPs and their social partners have experienced no industrial action for a significant period of time.  Our Free Movement Call for Action campaign proposes a menu of measures which we believe provide a good basis to address the impact of industrial action on consumers and businesses. We will continue to work proactively on the campaign which has been a top priority for us since the launch of A4E”, said Thomas Reynaert, Managing Director of Airlines for Europe.

"The IAA has successfully completed operational trials on remote tower technology. In 2016, the IAA, along with a consortium of stakeholders, validated the SESAR JU concept of remote tower technology through a series of operational trials (based on over 50 demonstrations). These highly successful trials built upon the experience of single remote tower operations and validated the capability for single air traffic controller operation of multiple remote towers.

Peter Kearney, Director of ATM Operations and Strategy, IAA said, “Following these trials, we firmly believe that tower services at multiple airports can be safely provided by a single air traffic controller remotely. With carefully designed procedures, it will almost certainly be possible to allow one controller to simultaneously provide ATM services for more than one low volume aerodrome. This would be subject of course to successful completion of safety assessments, regulatory approval and appropriate stakeholder consultation.”

He added that, “The IAA has a strong tradition of being innovative to deliver cost efficiency, improved safety and higher productivity levels.  With this in mind, we are delighted with the outcome of our recent Remote Tower technology trials. We believe this work represents the world’s first trial of multiple tower remote operation’s by a single air traffic controller.”

In March 2016, the IAA completed the system installation, which was supplied by Saab. This was composed of three main elements:

From June to August 2016, the IAA worked to validate the system through operational trials, which tested the bounds of remote tower technology. Trials started with low volume traffic levels to emulate nighttime operations at Shannon and Cork. Traffic levels were then progressively increased throughout the trials to investigate the level of air traffic that can be safely handled. These trial validated that single controller operation of multiple remote towers in a live air traffic environment, this we believe is a world first.

IAA also demonstrated the significant safety benefits from the enhanced visual displays offered by the Remote Tower Centre. These include integrated track and label information as well as the ability to digitally enhance imagery.

“There are many critical areas to be addressed and these trials are a significant milestone in proving the reliability and integrity of these systems. Remote tower technology will play a vital role in the future of air traffic service provision for aerodromes across the world including Ireland” added Mr. Kearney.

This technology is still at a relatively early stage of development, with only a few operational implementations at isolated airports with few movements. Remotely operated towers do offer significant potential to assist air navigation service providers (ANSPs) to reduce and control their costs in line with airline and European Commission expectations without negatively impacting on safety and/or service delivery. This potential is greatest at smaller, less busy regional airports where the volume of traffic is likely to be insufficient to cover the costs of service provision at a user charge that is sustainable from the customers’ perspective. Furthermore, remotely operated towers may also provide a solution for busier airports in terms of effectively managing operations at night time and other periods of low traffic. The potential of remotely operated towers will, however, only be realised if safety and operational reliability are guaranteed. To this end, early regulatory approval in Europe is required.

The IAA wishes to thank the SESAR JU, our consortium partners, the DAA and Stobart Air as well as all of our other customers for the support and encouragement received with this highly innovative project.

"Rohde & Schwarz safeguarded Austria's AirPower 2016 air show against the security risk of commercial drones encroaching on the show's airspace. This was accomplished using the R&S ARDRONIS radiomonitoring solution that enables users to identify drone control signals early on, to locate and even stop the drone.

Remote control microdrones are constantly invading the privacy of individuals and violating the boundaries of protected areas. These flying objects pose a safety risk at airports where they interfere with air traffic flow and a security risk at major events. At an air show, both of these are a factor, as any disruption of the closely timed take-offs and landings can represent a danger to event participants and spectators alike. To counteract such a risk, the Austrian Armed Forces relied on the R&S ARDRONIS radiomonitoring system. Working in cooperation with Rohde & Schwarz, AirPower 2016 was the first event to operate a test setup tailored to these special requirements.

R&S ARDRONIS enables users to locate the operator of a remote controlled microdrone and intervene in a timely manner. Remote controls for microdrones usually operate in the 2.4 GHz or 5.8 GHz ISM band, but also in other frequency bands such as 433 MHz or 4.3 GHz. The R&S ARDRONIS solution monitors the signals in the relevant frequency bands. It maintains an extensive library of drone control signal profiles in order to detect and classify these types of signals. R&S ARDRONIS reliably and automatically detects the remote control of a commercial drone within a 1 km radius.

The R&S ARDRONIS system used at AirPower 2016 was additionally equipped with direction finding functionality. The direction information obtained can be used to find the person with the remote control. If the drone transmits a video downlink, this signal will also be located. The information is clearly shown on a map on the display.

Other options are available for R&S ARDRONIS. For example, it can disrupt specific drone control signals to prevent the drone from performing a maneuver that poses a safety threat. Only the signals for controlling the drones are disrupted. Other signals in the vicinity are not affected. In contrast to broadband interferers that affect the entire frequency band, the ISM band continues to be available for other services such as Bluetooth® or WLAN, or to control private drones.",air-traffic

"During the night of 24th January 2017, Reims UAC handled, for the first time, actual air traffic using the future French Air Traffic Management system 4-FLIGHT and the advanced Flight Data Processing System, Coflight. 

 

This event marks a major milestone for DSNA, the French air navigation service provider (ANSP) and its industrial partner, Thales, the world leader in air traffic management, in their longstanding partnership to develop France’s next generation ATC system. For this operation, Coflight was directly connected to Network Manager Operation Centre (EUROCONTROL)’s data. It allows air traffic controllers to optimise trajectories and thus, deliver optimum performance to airspace users. Coflight uses the most advanced 4D trajectory processing enabling powerful 4-FLIGHT ATC tools. This live trial took place in stand-alone mode to respect the safety conditions validated by the National Supervisory Authority. 

 

Elsa, controller-expert for 4-FLIGHT who handled the system during the live trial, explained with enthusiasm : ”Seeing 4-FLIGHT in operational use for the first time was a high point in my professional career and an insight into what our work will be in the future. It opens up a whole new, promising chapter in our operations!” 

 

The objective of this exercise was to evaluate a first level of system integration, including technical monitoring and its new components. Several night and day live operations will be conducted at the two pilot sites, Reims and Marseille ACCs, in 2017 and 2018 in order to optimise the switchover process and to give operational users the possibility to gain first in-live experience with the new system. The next live trial for 4-FLIGHT / Coflight is scheduled to take place at Marseille ACC on the night of the 15th March 2017. 

 

The 4-FLIGHT system, co-financed by the European Union, is defined by DSNA and developed by Thales. Coflight is defined by DSNA and ENAV, the Italian ANSP, and developed by the Franco-Italian Thales / Leonardo industrial consortium. In 2016, the French air navigation services handled 3 million flights.

"Frequentis’ Location Information Service provided situational awareness for ground control stations during NASA’s latest Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Traffic Management (UTM) flight tests at Reno Stead airport in Nevada. Drone Co-Habitation Services LLC, partnering with Frequentis, participated in NASA led test to track flight missions and facilitate air traffic management of drones.

During the month of October NASA conducted its latest series of drone flight tests at Reno Stead Airport in Nevada. Multiple teams flew their drones beyond the line of sight of their operators in order to test the planning, tracking and alerting capabilities of NASA’s UTM platform.

The Frequentis Location Information Service (LIS) is at the core of the company’s UTM client software and provided accurate geo-location and telemetry data received from Drone Co-Habitation Services LLC (DCS) drones and other UAS detected by the LIS service. The LIS service read the data, transformed it into structured messages, and submitted it for processing to the central UTM service operated by NASA’s Ames Research Center.

NASA’s ‘out of sight’ tests, conducted in coordination with the Federal Aviation Administration and several partners, were the latest waypoint in solving the challenge of drones flying beyond the visual line of sight of their human operators without endangering other aircraft.

Frequentis is actively participating in research activities and cooperates with Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSP) around the globe to integrate small UAS into the airspace as the number of drones is expected to exceed the number of aircraft in approximately 5 years. At the moment, small UAS flight operations are only permitted in uncontrolled airspace up to 400 feet, and respectively 500 feet depending on national regulations, within visual line of sight of the pilot. This exempts them from classic air traffic management, which raises major safety concerns for ANSPs.

“Drones are causing a major disruption in today’s air traffic management systems. We see many new stakeholders that would like to fly in controlled and uncontrolled airspace. As a leading provider of advanced ATM solutions, Frequentis is contributing to the development of new concepts for unmanned aircraft systems traffic management (UTM)”, states Hannu Juurakko, Vice President ATM Civil at Frequentis.",air-traffic

"On the heels of a successful launch of the first ten Iridium NEXT satellites on Saturday, January 14th, Aireon announced today that it has signed a data services agreement with Isavia, the Icelandic Air Navigation Service Provider (ANSP). Isavia will deploy Aireon’s space-based Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) service throughout the Reykjavik Oceanic Control Area (OCA). In addition to providing enhanced redundancy to existing terrestrial surveillance resources in the southern part of the airspace, the AireonSM service will, for the first time ever, provide real-time surveillance and tracking in the region extending from 70 degrees north to the North Pole. 



With control of more than 5.4 million square kilometers of airspace, Isavia is looking to improve safety, and efficiency (through reduced separation) of operations by expanding the ADS-B service area. Continuity of service will be enhanced through use of Aireon’s technology in airspace where line-ofsight surveillance is already. 



“Aireon is already working with our colleagues at NAV CANADA and UK NATS to introduce this capability for oceanic crossings in the North Atlantic. We had initially signed a memorandum of agreement to ensure the benefits would be realized, not only with safety, but also efficiency,” said Asgeir Palsson director, Air Navigation Services, Isavia. “The benefits speak for themselves, and we are working closely with our North Atlantic neighbors. We anticipate optimizing the 160,000 flights that use our airspace every year.” 



Isavia’s northerly location makes it a key player in the North Atlantic (NAT) region bordering Gander Oceanic Flight Information Region (FIR), controlled by NAV CANADA, and Shanwick Oceanic FIR, controlled by NATS, to the south, and Bodo Oceanic and Murmansk FIRs in the northern part. Spacebased ADS-B will provide a best-in-class technology for this region of the NAT, and give participating ANSPs 100 percent, real-time coverage. Isavia will also be conducting flight trials in polar airspace north of 70 degrees to evaluate the expected benefits of previously unavailable surveillance in polar airspace. 



“Isavia, given their location, have a strategic mission to utilize the most advanced technology. Not only will they use Aireon for increasing safety, but they will also use it as a contingency source of surveillance to add an extra layer to their robust series of cutting-edge technologies,” said Cyriel Kronenburg, Vice President, Aviation Services, Aireon. “We will also be working closely with Isavia to test the impact of real-time surveillance in the North Pole. Isavia will soon have the ability to track a flight across the entire polar region, in real-time, an unprecedented capability in the history of aviation.”",air-traffic

"The International Air Transport Association (IATA) announced global passenger traffic results for October showing that demand (measured in revenue passenger kilometers, or RPKs) rose 5.8% compared to the same month last year. Capacity grew 6.3% and load factor slid 0.4 percentage points to 80.1%.

October’s performance was a slow-down on the 7.1% year-on-year growth rate recorded in September but still was broadly in line with 10-year averages. Domestic and international travel growth largely was in balance.

""Passenger demand growth in October was consistent with long-term trends but represented a deterioration compared to September. While the negative traffic impact from terror attacks and political instability in parts of the world has receded, the long downward trend in yield—which helped to stimulate travel--has leveled off. Furthermore, the recent OPEC agreement to restrict oil production suggests fuel prices have ended their slide,"" said Alexandre de Juniac, IATA’s Director General and CEO.

 October international passenger demand rose 5.9% compared to October 2015. Airlines in all regions recorded growth. Total capacity rose faster, up 6.6%, causing load factor to slide 0.6% percentage points to 78.6%.

Domestic demand climbed 5.6% in October compared to October 2015, which was matched by a similar increase in capacity. There was continued wide variation in individual country results, with India and China enjoying double-digit growth rates while other markets experienced much slower growth and Brazil remained in decline.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) released data for global air freight markets in October 2016 showing that demand, measured in freight tonne kilometers (FTKs), rose 8.2% year-on-year in October. This was the fastest pace of growth seen in 18 months. Freight capacity, measured in available freight tonne kilometers (AFTKs), increased 3.6% over the same period.

""Global air freight markets look set to end 2016 on a high note. Demand is growing at its fastest pace in 18 months. It remains to be seen how long this growth trend will endure after the year-end peak period and we still face headwinds from weak global trade. But there are some encouraging signs. The peak has been stronger than expected. And purchasing managers are reporting a pick-up in new export orders. So we will enter 2017 propelled by some much-needed positive momentum,"" said Alexandre de Juniac, IATA’s Director General and CEO.

Some one-off factors are likely impacting October’s positive results: (1) there is potential modal shift to air cargo following the collapse of the Hanjin Shipping Company in August and (2) there could be some last minute reliance on air transport as companies exercised caution in ordering as a result of weak market conditions earlier in the year.

Structural market shifts are also likely underpinning a portion of the stronger performance. This includes strong growth in cross-border e-commerce and pharmaceutical flows. Preparation for the increasing popularity of sales events such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday may also have contributed to the increased demand peak.

""The drivers of stronger growth are sending a major signal for change to the air cargo industry. Whether it is e-commerce or the trade in pharmaceuticals, shippers are demanding more than current paper processes can support. The shift to e-freight is more critical than ever,"" said de Juniac

above 11,000 metres.



Free Route means that Enav will ensure that more than 3,500 flights a day can take flight

paths that are, on average, shorter by about 17.5 km, with a saving of about 1 minute and 20""

providing lower fuel consumption ranging from about 55 kg for an Airbus 300 to about 300

kg for an Airbus 380. Environmental benefits will be even greater with 3 kg of fewer CO2

emissions in the atmosphere for each kg of lower fuel consumption per aircraft.

We are talking about a total reduction of 61,250 km per day for airlines operating in the skies

over Italy.



If we assume the lowest level of consumption (i.e. 55 kg for the Airbus 300) for all the 3,500

flights a day above 11,000 metres, the total savings will be about 140,000 Euros.

Enav is the first among the five major European service providers to implement Free Route,

in line with the European rules on the Single European Sky which must be brought in by all

European states by 1 January 2022.



With the implementation of the Free Route program, Enav has completed its reorganization

plan for Italian airspace, started in 2014. It allows maximum flight efficiency to be achieved,

generating benefits for both airlines and the environment.

  

The CEO Roberta Neri stated: This result has been achieved thanks to two key factors:

technological development and the quality of our operational staff. We are particularly proud

to be the first to implement such an important project at European level and to offer airlines

flying over Italy a service that increasingly meets their needs, while maintaining maximum

levels of safety.",air-traffic
"The International Air Transport Association (IATA) announced that it expects the global airline industry to make a net profit in 2017 of $29.8 billion. On forecast total revenues of $736 billion, that represents a 4.1% net profit margin. This will be the third consecutive year (and the third year in the industry’s history) in which airlines will make a return on invested capital (7.9%) which is above the weighted average cost of capital (6.9%).

IATA revised slightly downward its outlook for 2016 airline industry profitability to $35.6 billion (from the June projection of $39.4 billion) owing to slower global GDP growth and rising costs. This will still be the highest absolute profit generated by the airline industry and the highest net profit margin (5.1%).

""Airlines continue to deliver strong results. This year we expect a record net profit of $35.6 billion.  Even though conditions in 2017 will be more difficult with rising oil prices, we see the industry earning $29.8 billion. That’s a very soft landing and safely in profitable territory. These three years are the best performance in the industry’s history—irrespective of the many uncertainties we face. Indeed, risks are abundant— political, economic and security among them. And controlling costs is still a constant battle in our hyper-competitive industry,"" said Alexandre de Juniac, IATA’s Director General and CEO.

""We need to put this into perspective. Record profits for airlines means earning more than our cost of capital. For most other businesses that would be considered a normal level of return to investors. But three years of sustainable profits is a first for the airline industry. And after many years of hard work in restructuring and re-engineering the business the industry is also more resilient. We should also recognize that profits are not evenly spread with the strongest performance concentrated in North America,"" said de Juniac.

While airline industry profits are expected to have reached a cyclical peak in 2016 of $35.6 billion, a soft landing in profitable territory is expected in 2017 with a net profit of $29.8 billion. 2017 is expected to be the eighth year in a row of aggregate airline profitability, illustrating the resilience to shocks that have been built into the industry structure. On average, airlines will retain $7.54 for every passenger carried.

Expected higher oil prices will have the biggest impact on the outlook for 2017. In 2016 oil prices averaged $44.6/barrel (Brent) and this is forecast to increase to $55.0 in 2017. This will push jet fuel prices from $52.1/barrel (2016) to $64.9/barrel (2017). Fuel is expected to account for 18.7% of the industry’s cost structure in 2017, which is significantly below the recent peak of 33.2% in 2012-2013.

The demand stimulus from lower oil prices will taper off in 2017, slowing traffic growth to 5.1% (from 5.9% in 2016). Industry capacity expansion is also expected to slow to 5.6% (down from 6.2% in 2016). Capacity growth will still outstrip the increase in demand, thus lowering the global passenger load factor to 79.8% (from 80.2% in 2016).

The negative impact of a lower load factor is expected to be offset somewhat by a strengthening of global economic growth. World GDP is projected to expand by 2.5% in 2017 (up from 2.2% in 2016). Along with structural changes in the industry, this is expected to help stabilize yields for both the cargo and passenger businesses. This is a welcome development as yields (calculated in dollar terms) have fallen each year since 2012.

There is some optimism over the prospects for the cargo business in 2017. The break in falling yields and a moderate uptick in demand (3.5%) will see cargo industry volumes reach a record high of 55.7 million tonnes (up from 53.9 million tonnes in 2016). Industry revenues are expected to rise slightly to $49.4 billion (still well below the $60 billion level of annual revenues experienced in 2010-2014). Trading conditions remain challenging.

""Connectivity continues to set new records. We expect nearly 4 billion travelers and 55.7 million tonnes of cargo in the coming year. And almost 1% of global GDP is spent on air transport—some $769 billion. Air transport has made the world more accessible than ever and it is a critical enabler of the global economy,"" said de Juniac.

""Governments, however, do not make aviation’s work easy. The global tax bill has ballooned to $123 billion. Over 60% of countries put visa barriers in the way of travel. And the total number of ticket taxes exceeds 230. Billions of dollars are wasted in direct costs and lost productivity as a result of inefficient infrastructure. These are only some of the hurdles which confront airlines. Our aim is to work in partnership to help governments better understand and fully maximize the social and economic benefits of efficient global air links,"" said de Juniac.

North American carriers : The strongest financial performance is being delivered by airlines in North America. Net post-tax profits will be the highest at $18.1 billion next year, although down slightly from the $20.3 billion expected in 2016. The net margin for the region’s carriers is also expected to be the strongest at 8.5% with an average profit of $19.58/passenger. In 2017 capacity offered by the region’s carriers is expected to grow by 2.6%, slightly outpacing expected demand growth of 2.5%. Recent consolidation continues to underpin the region’s strong profitability, even as the region faces upwards cost pressures which include the price of fuel.

European carriers : Airlines based in Europe are expected to post an aggregate net profit of $5.6 billion in 2017 which is below the $7.5 billion for 2016. Nonetheless, carriers there are forecast to generate a 2.9% net profit margin and a per passenger profit of $5.65. There remains a significant gap between the performance of the region’s carriers and the performance of North American ones. Capacity in 2017 is expected to grow by 4.3%, ahead of demand growth which is forecast at 4.0%. The region is subject to intense competition and hampered by high costs, onerous regulation and high taxes. And terrorist threats remain a real risk, even if confidence is starting to return after the tragic incidents in recent times.

Asia-Pacific carriers : Airlines in the Asia-Pacific region are expected to generate a net profit of $6.3 billion in 2017 (down from $7.3 billion in 2016) for a net margin of 2.9%. On a per passenger basis average profits are anticipated to be $4.44. Capacity offered by the region’s carriers is forecast to grow by 7.6%, ahead of a forecast growth in demand of 7.0%. Improved cargo performance is expected to offset rising fuel prices for many of the region’s airlines. The expansion of new model airlines and progressive liberalization in the region is intensifying already strong competition. In addition profitability varies widely across the region.

Middle Eastern carriers : Middle Eastern airlines are forecast to generate a net profit of $0.3 billion for a net margin of 0.5% and an average profit per passenger of $1.56. This is below the $900 million profit expected in 2016. Average yields for the region’s carriers are low but unit costs are even lower, partly driven by the strong capacity expansion, forecast at 10.1% this year, ahead of expected demand growth of 9.0%. Threats are emerging to the success story of the Gulf carriers, including increases in airport charges across the Gulf States and growing air traffic management delays.

Latin American carriers : Latin American airlines are expected to post a net profit of $200 million, which is slightly lower than the $300 million forecast for 2016. Profit per passenger is expected to be $0.76 with a net profit margin of 0.7%. Capacity offered by the region’s carriers is forecast to grow by 4.8% which is ahead of expected demand growth of 4.0%. Despite some signs of improvement in the region’s currencies and economic prospects, operating conditions remain challenging, with infrastructure deficiencies, high taxes, and a growing regulatory burden across the continent. Venezuela continues to block the repatriation of some $3.8 billion of industry funds in contravention of international obligations.

African carriers : Carriers in Africa are expected to deliver the weakest financial performance with a net loss of $800 million (broadly unchanged from 2016). For each passenger flown this amounts to an average loss of $9.97. Capacity in 2017 is expected to grow by 4.7%, ahead of 4.5% demand growth. The region’s weak performance is being driven by regional conflict and the impact of low commodity prices.

2016 will be a record year for industry profitability. The expected net profit of $35.6 billion is slightly ahead of the $35.3 billion recorded in 2015, as is the 5.1% net profit margin (slightly ahead of the 4.9% recorded for 2015).

The modest revision from previous expectations largely is owing to two factors:

""Air transport is the business of freedom. The safe and efficient global movement of goods and people is a positive force in our world. Aviation’s success betters peoples’ lives by creating economic opportunity and supporting global understanding. We must stand firm in the face of any rhetoric that would put limits on aviation’s future success,"" said de Juniac.

Some key indicators of the strength of global connectivity include:

"A professional forum was held in Budapest with the participation of pilots, navigation and ATC experts from five international airlines – Austrian Airlines, easyJet, Etihad, Ryanair and Wizz Air –, the representatives of Budapest Airport and HungaroControl’s air traffic controllers, flight safety and ATM system design specialists. Upon HungaroControl’s initiative, key aviation stakeholders met for the third time to jointly discuss and analyse issues related to increasing flight safety and improving air navigation services, work processes and procedures. The findings of this year’s two-day forum facilitate both the intensification of communication between pilots and air traffic controllers and efficient route and procedure design, and thus make aviation more economical and environmentally friendly in the airspace controlled by Hungarian air traffic controllers.

At the third Key Customers Meeting and Workshop organised within the framework of the HungaroControl Service Quality and Customer Satisfaction Programme, air traffic controllers, airline pilots as well as flight safety and navigation experts discussed the current topics in three working groups. This year, the working groups were organised around the three ATC units, i.e. ACC, APP and TWR. The key topics of the working groups included the planned cross-border extension of Free Route Airspace; the fine-tuning of the recently introduced arrival procedures in the Budapest terminal area; and issues related to single-runway operations at Budapest Airport.

HungaroControl launched its service quality and customer satisfaction programme with the first customer satisfaction survey in October 2013 and the first Key Customers Meeting and Workshop in November 2013. The more than five hundred airline pilots who participated in the survey in 2016 confirmed that HungaroControl’s perceived service quality is improving steadily, reaching the average rating of 4.63 on a scale of 5. Among the 18 airlines participating in the survey this year, key respondents include the pilots of Qatar Airways, Pegasus Airlines, Austrian Airlines, Turkish Airlines, Wizz Air, Etihad Airways, Ryanair, TAROM and British Airways.",air-traffic
"ENAV, the Italian ANSP has released a statement tonight over newspaper claims about their involvement with the Aireon company in North America.



Statement reads:

Rome, 2016, December 8 - In relation to the articles published today by certain Italian newspapers relative to the alleged irregularities of Enav’s investment in Enav North Atlantic LLC, Enav declares that it is totally extraneous to, and rejects in full, the allegations reported in the press.

Enav North Atlantic is a holding company formed to hold and manage Enav’s investment in Aireon. Aireon LLC is incorporated in the State of Delaware as a limited liability company in 2011 and is headquartered in the State of Virginia. Enav acquired an interest in Aireon from Iridium Satellite LLC in 2014. The Aireon Satellite System is intended to allow extensive surveillance of global air traffic routes, with particular focus on polar, oceanic and remote areas that are not currently covered by existing radar-based air traffic control services and will enable a coverage of 100% of the globe (today approximately 30% of the globe is covered by existing technology).

The investment foresees a payment by Enav of total consideration of approximately USD 61 million, to be paid in four instalments from 2014 to 2017, of which two instalments have been paid to this date. Upon the payment of the last instalment, which is expected to take place by December 31, 2017, ENAV will have a total interest of 12.5%. In addition to Enav North Atlantic, the following entities are members of Aireon: NAV Canada Satellite, Inc. (which holds a 51% interest), Iridium Satellite LLC (which holds a 24.5%. interest), Naviair Surveillance A/S (which holds a 6% interest) and Irish Aviation Authority Ltd (which holds a 6% interest). As is standard practice for this type of investment, Enav created a limited liability holding in Delaware, Enav North Atlantic LLC, to hold and manage its investment in Aireon. The State of Delaware is part of the United States of America and it is not a black listed country or state from a tax perspective; companies that operate in the State of Delaware are subject to taxation according to the state and US federal laws and international treaties.

Enav has provided full disclosure on the transaction during the course of legal due diligence performed during the IPO process and disclosed in the IPO Prospectus published on July 8, 2016, also in relation to the request for investigation made to the Court of Rome as disclosed in the supplement to the Prospectus published on July 19, 2016.

Enav confirms that in relation to the investment in Enav North Atlantic it has acted in total transparency and in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations providing full disclosure on its investment. Enav is providing full cooperation to the Rome Prosecutor’s Office and is confident that the full transparency and legitimacy of the investment in Aireon will be clarified.

Enav will undertake all actions in its power to seek compensation for the reputational and economical damages caused by the publication of false information in the press.",air-traffic
"EASA published today a proposal to the European Commission on new operational rules to better support pilot mental fitness. EASA’s proposal is part of its Action Plan following the Germanwings Flight 9525 accident.

Released in a document known as an Opinion (Opinion 14/2016) , the proposals include the following new requirements:

These requirements are contained in the so-called Air OPS Implementing Rules. The proposed rules have been subject to consultation with all stakeholders concerned. As part of a total system approach, they complement the proposals EASA issued in August of this year, on the update of medical requirements for pilots (Part-MED).

The proposals address relevant safety recommendations made after the Flight 9525 accident by the EASA-led Task Force, as well as by the French Bureau d’Enquêtes et d’Analyses (BEA).

The EASA Opinion will serve as the basis for a legislative proposal by the European Commission in the course of 2017. To support the implementation of the new rules, EASA has prepared draft guidance material (so-called Acceptable Means of Compliance and Guidance Material - AMC/GM), annexed to the Opinion. The final AMC/GM will be published when the new rules have been adopted by the Commission.

"PANSA - the Polish Air Navigation Services Agency (member of Baltic FAB) and their German partner DFS (member of FABEC) enhanced their collaboration by implementing a new direct routing structure to improve the accessibility of Berlin airports and facilitate the implementation of the free route concept between FAB BALTIC and FABEC. Both measures will benefit the European network concerning capacity and flight efficiency. They are part of the growing cooperation within the system development (iTEC).

On 11 November, both parties improved flows by implementing nine new direct routings (DCT’s) connecting within the upper airspace the traffic coming from the Baltic Sea towards Western Germany close to the French and Dutch borders. Most of those new routings are offered on H24 basis to ease the planning process of the airspace user which will benefit by reduced fuel consumption – meaning less cost and less emissions by using shorter routes. Concrete benefits are depending on the usage of this improved route structure by the airspace users and close cooperation between two ANSP’s.

On 8 December, DFS and PANSA implemented new hand-over points at the common border between the airspace controlled by both air navigation service providers. The objective is to elevate the highly congested control sectors close to Berlin airports and between Polish and German airspace. The agreement includes that flights coming from the east and currently approaching Berlin from the south will be shifted to the northern sectors. In addition, departures from Berlin airports will be allowed to turn earlier to the east. Both measures will reduce the complexity deriving from the current mixture of horizontal flows and vertical movements around Berlin and Polish and German Border. Because of the close cooperation between PANSA and DFS participants of FABEC and FAB BALTIC it is expected to reduce of flight times to Berlin airports by shortened routes.

The airspace of the six FABEC States of Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Switzerland is one of the busiest and most complex in the world. Most major European airports, major civil airways and military training areas are located in this area. FABEC airspace covers 1.7 million km² and handles about 5.5 million flights per year – 55% of European air traffic.

FAB BALTIC is the bridge between EAST – WEST and NORTH - SOUTH traffic flows in central Europe. It consists of the Polish and Lithuanian airspace, covering 410 126 km². Baltic FAB handles about one million flights annually.",air-traffic
"A consortium of European air navigation service providers (ANSPs) and airlines has optimised numerous arrival flows to nine airports in Europe. A total of 11,467 demonstration flights were conducted. Half of the 33 analysed flows have already been permanently implemented; seven are published in the Aeronautical Information Publication. Real savings achieved with the project’s demonstration flights amounted to 86 tonnes of fuel savings and a reduction of 270 tonnes of CO2 emissions. On an annual basis, the 33 optimised flows have the potential to erate fuel savings of 3,400 tonnes, which equals more than 10,700 tonnes of CO2 emissions according to calculations by EUROCONTROL.



“The aim was to develop more efficient descent profiles and reduce the environmental impact in busy and complex airspaces and across borders without compromising safety and capacity aspects”, says project manager Ilhan Akin, DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung.

The optimised decent profiles (ODP) project, which was co-funded by the SESAR Joint Undertaking, began its work at the end of 2014 and has just published its final results. It was conducted under the leadership of the German ANSP DFS together with the ANSPs of Austria (Austro Control), France (DSNA) and Switzerland (skyguide), as well as EUROCONTROL’s Maastricht Upper Area Control Centre (MUAC).

Air France (plus HOP!), Deutsche Lufthansa (together with the affiliated Austrian Airlines and Germanwings) and Swiss International Airlines conducted the demonstration flights to the airports of Basel, Berlin Tegel, Frankfurt, Geneva, Munich, Strasbourg, Stuttgart, Vienna and Zurich.

The optimum arrival is a continuous descent, which does not require considerable engine power and thus a reduced amount of fuel. In highly-frequented airspaces, which are shaped by national borders and handover points, this optimum is not always possible. Existing arrival flows can, however, often be improved. For example, instead of fixed handover points, level windows can be defined, which are then programmed in the flight management system of the aircraft. Another way of improving vertical flight efficiency is to remain at cruising altitude for a longer period of time before descending, since fuel consumption is lower at higher levels. The project also used, for example, flexible seasonal or runway dependent handover procedures.

“The project has shown that each and every improvement counts. The optimisations generate fuel savings and thus contribute to a more sustainable air transport in Europe. For the implementation of optimised profiles on a broad basis, a framework and standards need be further developed in close partnership with the airline operators,” explains Akin.

Florian Guillermet, Executive Director of the SESAR Joint Undertaking remarked: ""The ODP project represented an excellent opportunity to demonstrate more widely the considerable savings in terms of fuel and emissions that are possible with optimised arrival flows. It is clear that procedures like these will be key to achieving a high performing aviation across Europe in the coming years.”

"Indra, one of the premier global consulting and technology companies, will play a prominent role in the second phase of the program to create the Single European Sky, called SESAR 2020. The company will take part in 25 of the 27 projects launched at the beginning of this second phase, and in two cases it will be the project leader.

The contracts awarded to Indra are worth a total of 30 million euros.

SESAR is one of the world's most ambitious initiatives in the field of air traffic research and development. The project is transforming air travel in Europe by greatly enhancing efficiency, safety, punctuality, and convenience for passengers.

The first phase of the program ended in 2016, while the second phase, known as SESAR 2020, will be implemented over the next five years. The work in this phase is broken down into two broad packages. The first one commences now and will be executed between 2017 and 2019, and the second one will run from 2019 to 2021.

The award of these new contracts strengthens Indra's position in this strategic project promoted by the European Commission in partnership with Eurocontrol and the main companies in the sector. Indra has played a leading role in SESAR since it was launched in 2006.

Indra will lead two of the key projects that mark the beginning of SESAR 2020. The aim of the first one is to further the development of 4D trajectory-based flight management systems, a technology that allows aircraft to choose the most direct route and plan flights with an unprecedented accuracy and an error margin of only seconds regarding the landing time.

This project will enable Indra to continue the work it has already completed for SESAR. The company played a key role in the world's first flight trials ever performed with this technology, carried out in 2014 on a flight covering the Toulouse-Copenhagen route.

For SESAR 2020 Indra will provide new tools and more advanced capabilities to these 4D trajectory-based flight management systems, facilitating a single complete and real-time view of flight information for the entire aeronautical community.

This stage of the program will also include the first trials involving different countries, control centers and aircraft, aimed at testing the systems in an environment that reflects the real dimensions and complexity of the future Single European Sky.

With regard to the second project led by Indra, the company will focus on developing a series of common services for all the actors involved in managing flights in Europe, both civilian and military. These services will facilitate smoother and coordinated air traffic management while generating significant cost savings.

Specifically, the company will work to ensure that European navigation service providers can share a range of tools, including among others the system for redistributing and balancing capacity in situations of congestion, the trajectory prediction system that air traffic control centers across the whole of the continent will use, and the digital aeronautical charts service.

Seven real trials of the Single European Sky

With regard to the other projects, the company will focus on enhancing airport efficiency, implementing more advanced remote control towers, deploying state-of-the-art voice and satellite communication systems, enhancing the precision of air surveillance systems and aircraft guidance systems for surface and runway movements, and improving the compatibility between different technologies.

Indra will also take part in seven large-scale technological demonstrations involving several countries and designed to validate the technologies in a real environment. One of the most important demonstrations in this respect is the Collaborative Network Management project, aimed at improving air traffic and airport management in complex situations with a high volume of traffic.

These tests will be conducted in partnership with the navigation service providers and main airports of the United Kingdom, France and Spain, and with Eurocontrol. If successful, the solutions will be industrialized and implemented in control centers and airports across Europe.",air-traffic

"Air Transport World (ATW) has honoured NAVBLUE with the Aviation Technology Achievement A ward as part of their 2017 Annual Airline Industry Achievement Awards. The Award is one of the most coveted awards in the aviation industry. 

 

NAVBLUE has been nominated by a prestigious ATW editorial board of judges for its N-Flight Planning Solution. This award is given to a breakthrough system, technology or process that advances safety and efficiency in the global commercial airline industry.

 

NAVBLUE’S N-Flight Planning solution uniquely allows airlines, with its integration of a flight planning route optimization algorithm and Schneider Electric’s flight hazard forecast model, to operate more safely and efficiently – flight crews get advanced warning of areas to avoid that may contain turbulence, icing or storms – correspondingly offering greater customer and crew comfort along with a cost optimized route of flight. 



Karen Walker, ATW Editor-in-Chief, noted that, “It is this type of innovation that “falls behind the scenes” but can make a huge difference in day-to-day operations for the airline, its crews and its customers. Passengers hate turbulence and flying through bad weather; here is a technology that airlines can use to mitigate the discomfort. Crews can make informed decisions in their route planning that can both help avoid “hazards” such as storms and save fuel. This is a technology that is a win for everyone.” 



Shawn Mechelke, VP-N Software Services at NAVBLUE, is the author of the detailed nomination for the ATW Award and has also been involved in developing this technology and flight planning automation over the past six years. Mr. Mechelke commented that, “We are very excited to finally bring the vision of integrating NAVBLUE’s N-Flight Planning Solution with the industry’s leading aircraft specific turbulence, icing, and thunderstorm forecast model. Both Dispatchers and Flight Crews can now automatically plan routes of flight using very precise and accurate flight hazard forecasts that did not exist in the past. The days of looking at paper charts and manually adjusting routes of flight are now a practice of the past.” 



The ATW Airline Industry Achievement Awards recognize excellence across a broad range of airline operations and are widely considered as the most coveted in the aviation industry. The awards will be presented at the 43nd annual ATW Airline Industry Achievement Awards at a gala dinner on March 28 at the J.W. Marriott Essex House in New York.",air-traffic
"Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) that enter the protected airspace around airports can pose serious threats to safety. The FAA is coordinating with our government and industry partners to evaluate technologies that can be used safely to detect drones near airports.

This week, the the FAA and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) are conducting drone-detection research in the vicinity of Denver International Airport. This work is part of the FAA’s Pathfinder Program for UAS Detection at Airports and Critical Infrastructure.

The work in Denver is one of six technical evaluations scheduled over an 18-month period.

The State of Nevada and State of North Dakota UAS Test Sites conducted flight operations for the Denver evaluations. Industry partners involved in the Denver flights included CACI International, Liteye Systems and Sensofusion.

The FAA plans to capture the data and findings from the evaluations and draft recommendations for standards. These standards will guide the selection of drone-detection systems for airports nationwide.

In addition to DHS, the FAA’s federal research partners include the Department of Defense, FBI, Federal Communications Commission, Department of the Interior, Department of Energy, NASA, Department of Justice, Bureau of Prisons, US Secret Service and US Capitol Police.

"Efforts to reduce the amount of time aircraft spend in holding stacks before landing at Heathrow Airport are paying off, according to new statistics from air traffic control company, NATS.

Since 2014 NATS and Heathrow have been working together to find ways of cutting the amount of time aircraft spend in the stacks, with the latest figures now showing an average reduction of around a minute, equating to a saving of more than 3,000 hours that aircraft spend in the hold each year.

Average holding times were about 8.5 minutes at the beginning of 2014, with that figure now just over 7.5 minutes and falling as low as 6.5 minutes in August this year.

Juliet Kennedy, NATS Operations Director, said: “A minute out of average holding times might not sound a huge amount, but when you consider about 10,000 flights use the holds each month it adds up to a serious reduction in delay, carbon emissions, fuel burn and noise.”

NATS estimates that the fall in airborne holding has saved over 35,000 tonnes of CO2, the equivalent to more than 11,000 tonnes of fuel, worth £4m at current jet fuel prices.

Most passengers who have flown into Heathrow will have experienced their flight circling in one of the four holding stacks around London. The airport needs a ready supply of inbound traffic in order to ensure it makes the best use of its two runways. However, holding is inefficient in terms of fuel burn and emissions.

The reduction in holding has been achieved through the use of two new air traffic management tools. Introduced in April 2014, XMAN – or cross-border arrivals management – involves NATS coordinating with its counterparts in France, the Netherlands and Ireland to slow inbound aircraft down from 350 miles away, when delays over London begin to build.

As a result aircraft don’t land any later, but do spend less time circling in the holds.

A new way of separating arriving aircraft has also made a major contribution. Since March 2015 NATS has separated arriving aircraft into Heathrow by time instead of set distances in an effort to cut delays due to headwinds. Time Based Separation has cut headwind delays by over 50% and by helping to maintain the landing rate has also cut the time aircraft spend holding.

Jon Proudlove, Heathrow’s Airside Director, said: “Fewer delays and reduced emissions are the result of investment in innovative technology and collaborative working between Heathrow, NATS and airlines. This is a significant step forward in what will be a series of innovations supporting the predictable delivery to plan. A predictable operation is essential in delivering a great passenger experience and reducing environmental impact.”

Both changes are part of a wider initiative to modernise the UK’s airspace and air traffic management technologies.

"Aireon LLC, FlightAware and SITAONAIR today announced a new partnership to provide SITAONAIR’s airline customers with Aireon’s space-based automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) data. Starting in 2018, SITAONAIR airline customers with ADS-B Out equipped aircraft will have access to 100 percent global flight tracking data, in real time, through SITAONAIR’s AIRCOM® FlightTracker product.

The partnership also means that airlines already using SITAONAIR’s AIRCOM® FlightTracker product will automatically begin seeing the new AireonSM data appear in their systems without the need for new avionics or for aircraft modifications. Additionally, prospective customers can be up and running to receive the new data in as short as one week. The Aireon data will be delivered to SITAONAIR via FlightAware, which provides a secure streaming data feed of flight positions and flight status data via a combination of worldwide air traffic control data, ground-based ADS-B, and aircraft datalink information.

“At SITAONAIR, our focus is on products and solutions with specific value for the aviation community, particularly when it comes to aircraft tracking,” says Paul Gibson, portfolio director, AIRCOM® at SITAONAIR.  “The addition of Aireon’s space-based ADS-B data is a perfect evolution of this. It will allow us to help airlines achieve truly global flight tracking in a cost-effective way, by making use of the pre-existing ADS-B capability on aircraft of all shapes and sizes, without the need for additional avionics. Our partnership with Aireon and FlightAware helps further establish SITAONAIR’s AIRCOM® FlightTracker as an innovative, cutting-edge and value-add solution for airlines.  It strengthens SITAONAIR’s positon as a leader in safety-related IT and communications products and services for the industry.”

Currently, AIRCOM® FlightTracker is an ACARS and terrestrial surveillance-based system that provides regular flight position updates and requires no modification to aircraft.  The solution works by gathering data from multiple global sources, complementing active Air Navigation Service Provider (ANSP) Future Air Navigation System activity with additional automatic dependent surveillance-contract connectivity. The addition of Aireon’s space-based ADS-B data will for the first time provide 100 percent global coverage in real time, thereby resolving all data feed coverage gaps that may remain.

“This partnership brings together best-in-class companies to create a massive technological leap forward at the flick of a switch. The ability to provide 100 percent global flight tracking will address and solve a well established problem,” said FlightAware Chief Executive Officer, Daniel Baker.  “This holds particularly true for narrow-body aircraft that are not equipped with SATCOM datalink for oceanic tracks, nor capable of meeting even the most basic GADSS requirements.  The ability to add Aireon’s space-based ADS-B data to SITAONAIR’s existing and proven tracking solution will allow aircraft operators to go from either no oceanic or remote position updates, or 15 minute updates, to minute-by-minute updates – all with no additional avionics required.”

Aireon’s space-based ADS-B system will offer a global solution that works for ADS-B Out equipped aircraft everywhere.  Currently, operators engage in a costly, time consuming process of indexing all their aircraft, noting what types of equipment each had installed.  With various ADS-B Out mandates passed by ANSPs and industry governing bodies around the world, operators will automatically know that their aircraft are properly equipped.

“We’re proud to work with both FlightAware, our existing partner, and SITAONAIR, our new partner, in delivering this cutting-edge capability. SITAONAIR and FlightAware are industry stalwarts, and this partnership shows how industry leaders can come together to create a more cost-effective, simple to implement and more efficient flight tracking capability than ever before,” said Aireon Vice President of Aviation Services, Cyriel Kronenburg. “We are particularly excited to expand coverage to the oceans and especially polar airspace, which will have complete surveillance even before the Iridium NEXT satellite constellation is fully completed.”",air-traffic

"The International Air Transport Association (IATA) welcomed the European Commission’s revision of the Renewable Energy Directive (RED) to incentivize sustainable fuels, and urged policy-makers to go even further in prioritizing their use for air transport.

The largest user of renewable fuels, the road transport sector, has increasing options to move towards electrification; however, aviation has no technological option but to continue with liquid fuel at the present time. Therefore, there is a strong case for sustainable fuel policies to prioritize air transport, in order to boost supply and reduce costs.

""Aviation is on a path towards carbon-neutral growth and ultimately to reduce emissions in half. Sustainable fuels are an essential element of our carbon-cutting strategy, with the prospect of an 80% decrease in carbon compared to traditional jet fuel. Policies to incentivize the production of such fuels have been successful in the United States and elsewhere. Europe has an opportunity to take the lead in sustainable fuel production if the revised RED contains the right measures,"" said Michael Gill, IATA’s Director, Aviation Environment.

The European Commission’s stated aim is for Europe to become the leader in renewable energy, and the revision of the RED offers just such an opportunity. The current challenge with sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) is to boost supply and cut costs. Greater production will help to reduce prices, and reduced prices will encourage greater demand, thus boosting production. To break into this virtuous circle, the RED must strengthen its policy framework to incentivize production of SAF.

""Airlines are absolutely committed to the highest sustainability standards for alternative fuels, to ensure no interference with biodiversity, food production, or clean water resources. We are ready and willing to invest in these fuels and the revision of the RED offers a unique opportunity for Europe to demonstrate what can be achieved when policy-makers and industry combine for a genuinely coordinated approach to climate action and business innovation,"" said Gill.",air-traffic
"The European Commission (EC) and Innovation and Networks Executive Agency (INEA) yesterday visited a Borealis Free Route Airspace implementing partner Finavia at Helsinki Airport in Finland, to see how the EU funding has supported the deployment of Free Route Airspace in Northern Europe.

The deployment financed under the ‘Borealis Free Route Airspace, Part 1’ was selected by INEA and DG MOVE for an official visit amongst five SESAR projects financed under the Call 2014 of the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF), a key EU funding instrument to facilitate targeted infrastructure investment at European level.

The delegation was accompanied by representatives of the SESAR Deployment Manager and was hosted by Finavia, an implementing partner of the Borealis Free Route Airspace programme.

It is an ambitious initiative involving nine air navigation service providers – all members of the Borealis Alliance, a commercial partnership set up to facilitate cooperation between the members for the benefits of their customers.

The Alliance’s Free Route Airspace programme has already been highlighted by the EC as a major contributor to the vision of Single European Sky, awarding it one of the inaugural ‘SES’ awards in March 2016.

The visit showcased the Borealis Free Route Airspace in operation, currently connecting airspace across six North European states - Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Norway, and Sweden, where airlines can plan and fly their preferred trajectories across borders.

During the day, the delegates were introduced to this multi-stakeholder project through presentations, discussions and a visit to the Air Traffic Control Centre.

They also heard Finnair’s representative who attended the day and spoke on behalf of the airline customers highlighting the benefits of the Free Route implementation in Northern Europe.

In the Air Traffic Control Centre, guests were guided through the everyday en route operations. This included observing flights through and within the Finnish airspace, airspace management between both civil and military stakeholders and coordination with neighbouring Air Traffic Control Centres.

The delegation saw the concept in operation, the underlying technology and the benefits delivered to the Air Traffic Management network as safer, greener and cheaper air traffic.

Henrik Hololei, Director General, Mobility & Transport at European Commission, said: “The number of stakeholders involved in the Free Route Airspace project Borealis clearly shows that cross-border partnerships are possible, and represent a tremendous opportunity to increase the efficiency of our ATM, taking us one step closer to achieving a Single European Sky (SES).

“Not by chance, Borealis was one of the SES Awards winners this year.”

Dirk Beckers, INEA's Director, said: ""By overcoming fragmentation and delivering cross-border free route operations, the Borealis Free Route Airspace represents an outstanding example of beneficial cooperation and partnership among different stakeholders.

“It perfectly captures both the spirit of the Single European Sky and of the Connecting Europe Facility. This visit has given the opportunity to INEA to have a direct insight into the benefits that this key project is bringing to the ATM network and to all passengers.

“It showcased the progress made in delivering SESAR and reinforced the excellent collaboration between INEA, the SESAR Deployment Manager and the implementing partners.""

“This year Borealis Free Route Airspace programme was amongst the projects recognised by the European Commission with the Single European Sky (SES) award.

“This gave credit to all nine Alliance members working hard in delivering less fragmented, cheaper and greener air traffic to their customers in Northern Europe.

“Today we are happy to show the Commission and INEA the concept in operation. Borealis Alliance is fully committed to the spirits of the SES and will do its best to continue deployment of the free route airspace across a considerable piece of European airspace,” said Branka Subotić, Executive Director of the Borealis Alliance.

“We are happy to welcome the European Commission and INEA and showcase the real benefits that have already been delivered to our customers.

""What we already have today is free route airspace where airlines can plan and fly their preferred trajectories across six North European states, and it is expanding further.

“We are continuing the cooperation with our partners in the Borealis Alliance to multiply those benefits further,” said Raine Luojus, Senior Vice President of Finavia.

"A group of Saudi Arabian students have graduated from air traffic control studies with Airways New Zealand today, as the organisation helps to fill a critical gap globally for training of air traffic controllers.

 

 The 26 students graduated at a ceremony at Massey University in Palmerston North, marking the completion of a successful two-year investment by the General Authority of Civil Aviation of Saudi Arabia (GACA), and the Saudi Arabian National Guard.

 

 The students arrived in January 2015 and spent their first year in New Zealand studying English with Nelson Marlborough Institute of Technology (NMIT) and Kaplan International College in Auckland. They then started a 12-month air traffic control (ATC) course at Airways' purpose-built training facility on the Massey University campus in Palmerston North.

 

 In the past year Airways has trained about 150 ab-initio ATC students in New Zealand and at overseas campuses through its international training programmes, Airways Training General Manager Sharon Cooke says.

 

 “This is the third group of GACA students trained in New Zealand over the past five years.  We’re pleased to be providing top quality training services for overseas students, and at the same time helping to alleviate the current global shortage of air traffic controllers. This is a particular issue in the Middle East where air traffic growth is expected to continue,” she says.

 

 “We’re proud of our ongoing relationship with GACA which continues to send trainees to Airways due to the success of our programme. To date, all trainees have successfully completed on-job-training to become licenced ATCs once returning home,” Ms Cooke says.

 

 Ahmed Algharawi, one of the graduating students, says he enjoyed the pace and style of learning and living in New Zealand.

 

 “It was a bit of a shock coming to Nelson at first because my English wasn’t as good as it is now, but living with a homestay family really helped me improve. Living in New Zealand took some getting used to but now I’m going to find it hard to leave.”

 

 To help students adjust to living and learning in New Zealand, Airways used social media to create a learning community with the students before they arrived and while studying, with a dedicated Facebook page supporting them on anything from questions about their studies to their homestay environment and the culture in New Zealand.

 

 The students will now return to Saudi Arabia to begin their on-the-job training through GACA and Saudi Arabian National Guard.

Recommendations from both groups have significantly improved traditional aviation safety, and we expect the UAST to do the same for unmanned aircraft.

Although this first meeting was primarily organizational, team participants were enthusiastic about participating on the UAST and advancing the safe integration of UAS into the nation’s airspace.",air-traffic
"HH Sheikh Ahmed Bin Saeed AlMaktoum, Chairman of Dubai Airports; President of the Dubai Civil Aviation Authority; Chairman and CEO of Emirates Group, Chairman of Dubai Air Navigation Services (dans), announced the implementation of Approach Peak Offload (APO) procedure; an innovative air traffic management procedure that has led to an increase from 33.2 to 34.8 in average air traffic movements for arrivals during peak hours, as well as reduction of peak arrival delay by 40% at Dubai International Airport (DXB).

H.E.Mohammed A. Ahli, Director General of Dubai Civil Aviation Authority (DCAA) and CEO of Dubai Air Navigation Services (dans) stated: “Under the guidance, sponsorship and leadership of HH Sheikh Ahmed Bin Saeed Al Maktoum, we are committed to and continuously striving to “Transform the Sky” through developing and launching several key air traffic movements capacity enhancement projects in the Emirate of Dubai”. H.E. added: “Developing and implementing innovative procedures such as Approach Peak Offload (APO) have enabled us to deliver enhanced air traffic management services and accommodate the rising demand of our prestigious clientele with up to 86% during peak hours. We have significantly invested our resources in thoroughly assessing the procedure from the 1st of March and until its implementation in live operations through fast time and real time simulation exercises, this in turn has reinforced our efforts in building the safety case of the procedure which has been approved for implementation by the General Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA)”.

Exclusively designed and developed by the experienced operations team in dans, the APO procedure was created for the Dubai operational environment reflecting the most advanced solutions in the Aviation community .The procedure is one of several solutions implemented by dans to drive further efficiency in the Aviation sector, as it increases the volume of air traffic movements, while reducing possible delay timings for airlines. Since its recent implementation, the APO procedure has reduced peak arrival delay for Dubai arrivals which resonates in the effective reduction of fuel consumption and cost savings for the airlines. This has also enabled dans to play a key role in enhancing the overall traffic flow efficiency while concurrently playing an active role in conserving the environment, as the implementation of this procedure enabled reduction of CO2 emissions by up to 447 tons on monthly basis.

The APO procedure is a concept that is based on the possible re-allocation of lighter wake producing category aircrafts to Runway 30R during arrivals peak periods, thus accommodating the arrival flow more efficiently with the concurrent use of both runways at Dubai International Airport. One of the key components of this unique procedure permits lighter category aircraft to maintain a horizontal separation of 4.5NM behind the A380 Super aircraft while landing. Experts at dans reached the new wake separation minima levels between aircrafts based on the results of the safety case which included an in depth quantitative and qualitative wake data analysis.

Dubai Air Navigation services (dans) is the Air Navigation Service Provider that manages the Dubai and Northern Emirates airspace. dans also provides air navigation services for airport authorities and numerous prestigious airlines, including the World’s busiest airport in terms of international passenger numbers-Dubai International Airport (DXB).

"Budapest 2.0, a project with international collaboration has demonstrated the benefits of three technological innovations co-financed by SESAR, the organisation setting the directions for the development of air traffic management in Europe, through real flights. The program has demonstrated the capabilities of solutions supporting continuous descent, the benefits of satellitebased arrival procedures, and the applicability of remote tower control in the vicinity of Budapest Ferenc Liszt International Airport. These demonstrations were evaluated during a professional workshop held in the middle of November at HungaroControl's headquarters. The total budget of the project is nearly EUR 2.5 million, 50 percent of which has been funded by SESAR Joint Undertaking.

The 6-member international consortium, which has performed the demonstration, started to work together on the initiative by HungaroControl and Pildo Labs from Spain. The consortium included Wizz Air, JetStream, SLOT Consulting, and the Polytechnic University of Catalonia as its key members; LPS (the air navigation service provider of Slovakia) and Vueling as supporting members, and Budapest Airport as an observer. They tested innovations prioritised by SESAR and essential for efficient operations in European aviation in the future. The consortium specifically aimed to introduce technological innovations and procedures that enhance the operational environment of small and medium-sized airports, and improve flight safety, cost-efficiency and environmental impact for both airlines and air navigation service providers. The first pillar of the project was to develop arrival procedures to support continuous descent operations. HungaroControl took part in the complex process of creating descent profiles in two stages. One aspect involved the modification of arrival procedures of Budapest Terminal Manoeuvring Area; another aspect was to use a supporting software with the main purpose of helping air traffic controllers to determine the sequence of arriving aircrafts. While using the software, the controller gets a simple visual image of the actual order of arriving aircrafts, the distances between them, and their deviation from the ideal descent profile. The procedures introduced in the framework of the project can be used by all flights arriving at Budapest airport from 26th May.

The second pillar of the project was to test a satellite-based arrival procedure, which provides pilots with navigation support to fly the exact glide path without the need of ground installations. Validation flights, in co-operation with Pildo Labs, were performed and evaluated using PLATERO, the Spanish company's own tool. After validation, these procedures became available for flights arriving at Budapest, but they require proper navigation equipment on the aircraft. It has also been concluded that these procedures can temporarily replace groundbased ILS at large airports (e.g. during maintenance), or provide an alternative solution at smaller airports.

The third pillar of the project was to demonstrate the usage of Remote Tower with live traffic. HungaroControl started to explore the possibilities of remote tower control years ago. In the framework of this project, a remote tower environment was created for demonstration purposes at HungaroControl's headquarters. A video wall is used to display aerodrome visuals necessary for air traffic controllers to perform their tasks, providing a view substantially different from the view from the control tower. The demonstration proved that this kind of technology is suitable for both contingency purposes and live control, and also provided important findings regarding further development.

The results of this 2-year programme will soon be available for the stakeholders of the ATM industry, providing them with a solid basis for the implementation of these solutions adapted to local requirements.",air-traffic

"By 2050, it is estimated that there will be some 7 million consumer leisure drones in operation across Europe, including a fleet of 400 000 drones offering important services across the agricultural, energy, e-commerce, transport as well as public sectors. With an estimated value of EUR 15 billion annually, this market represents a huge potential for Europe and its global competitiveness. However the next years will be critical to ensuring the right ecosystem at European level is in place, all the main stakeholders are on board and research and innovation efforts are identified. These are some of the main findings of a study published today by the SESAR Joint Undertaking, the public-private partnership responsible for modernising European air traffic management. 

 

 The “SESAR Drones Outlook Study” provides a snapshot of the drone landscape in 2050 and how  new markets will unfold:



 Setting up a competitive European drone market would improve connectivity, as well as allow economic growth and the creation of jobs. Such a market would also support the EU aviation strategy by embracing a new era of innovation while helping maintain the high EU safety performance standards. Unlocking the full potential of the market is dependent on the ability of these new vehicles to operate safely in various airspaces, including at very low altitude levels. This requires continued support to boost R&D capabilities and establish a suitable framework for the market to unfold. 

  

 Much of what still needs to be done relates to traffic management technology needs (such as detect and avoid and air/ground data communications), Air Traffic Management operational procedures, security and cyber reliance along with the availability of authorised and safe testing environments. Finally, the study notes that it will be critical to act quickly given the pace of global development in drone operations.

  

 “The drone market is clearly set to bring significant benefits all over Europe and the continuation of that growth appears to be a matter of not if, but when. Europe must be ready with the right procedures and technologies to manage that new traffic safely and securely. With the right level of investment and engagement from the stakeholders, we are confident that SESAR can support this endeavour,” said Florian Guillermet, Executive Director, SESAR Joint Undertaking.",air-traffic
"The 41 Member States of EUROCONTROL have mandated the Agency to prepare for the deployment of the European Air/Ground Data Communication Service (EAGDCS). A Directive to this effect from the Organisation’s governing body has been approved, in full consistency with the European Union Council Decision in June this year (2016/1124) that entrusted EUROCONTROL with this important project.

 

 EUROCONTROL will collaborate with the Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs) of its Member States and with aircraft operators, all within the context of the SESAR project, to develop the necessary Governance, Financing and Procurement arrangements and to develop technical specifications. 

 

 As an initial step EUROCONTROL is organising a workshop in November to kick-off the project in the view of setting up the framework to start delivering the EAGDCS service in compliance with (EU) 2015/310 timeframe (5 February 2018 for Air Navigation Service Providers) and with the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 716/2014, and in particular ATM Functionality 6, Initial Trajectory Information Sharing (1 January 2025 for ATS providers and the Network Manager).

 

 Air/Ground Data Communication services allow controllers and pilots to communicate with each other safely, in a way that reduces the chance of miscommunication and frees up radio channels for more urgent messages.  It is also an important step towards the SESAR concept of 4D trajectories, allowing exchange of data from the Flight Management System of the aircraft to the ATC Centre and providing the controller with real time information on the pilot’s intentions; this will be a major safety and efficiency improvement.

 

 Frank Brenner, the Director General of EUROCONTROL, commented “The implementation of reliable air/ground data communication services is a vital enabler for the SESAR Operational Concept.  It is clear that the difficulties relating to the initial deployment of Datalink in Europe were largely because it was not deployed in a coherent and fully managed way.  EAGDCS takes full account of the lessons learnt in the EASA report and the SESAR Joint Undertaking studies; it represents a practical and effective way forward.”",air-traffic

"The International Air Transport Association (IATA) expects 7.2 billion passengers to travel in 2035, a near doubling of the 3.8 billion air travelers in 2016. The prediction is based on a 3.7% annual Compound Average Growth Rate (CAGR) noted in the release of the latest update to the association’s 20-Year Air Passenger Forecast.

""People want to fly. Demand for air travel over the next two decades is set to double. Enabling people and nations to trade, explore, and share the benefits of innovation and economic prosperity makes our world a better place,"" said Alexandre de Juniac, IATA’s Director General and CEO.

The forecast for passenger growth confirms that the biggest driver of demand will be the Asia-Pacific region. It is expected to be the source of more than half the new passengers over the next 20 years. China will displace the US as the world’s largest aviation market (defined by traffic to, from and within the country) around 2029. India will displace the UK for third place in 2026, while Indonesia enters the top ten at the expense of Italy. Growth will also increasingly be driven within developing markets. Over the past decade the developing world’s share of total passenger traffic has risen from 24% to nearly 40%, and this trend is set to continue.

The 20-year forecast puts forward three scenarios. The central scenario foresees a doubling of passengers with a 3.7% annual CAGR. If trade liberalization gathers pace, demand could triple the 2015 level. Conversely, if the current trend towards trade protectionism gathers strength, growth could cool to 2.5% annual CAGR which would see passenger numbers reach 5.8 billion by 2035.

""Economic growth is the only durable solution for the world’s current economic woes. Yet we see governments raising barriers to trade rather than making it easier. If this continues in the long-term, it will mean slower growth and the world will be poorer for it. For aviation, the protectionist scenario could see growth slowing to as low as 2.5% annually. Not only will that mean fewer new aviation jobs, it will mean that instead of 7.2 billion travelers in 2035, we will have 5.8 billion. The economic impact of that will be broad and hard-felt,"" said de Juniac.

Whatever scenario is eventually realized, growth will put pressure on infrastructure that is already struggling to cope with demand.  ""Runways, terminals, security and baggage systems, air traffic control, and a whole raft of other elements need to be expanded to be ready for the growing number of flyers. It cannot be done by the industry alone. Planning for change requires governments, communities and the industry working together in partnership,"" said de Juniac.

The industry will also need to be able to grow sustainably. Earlier this month airlines supported the establishment of a Carbon Offset and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). This landmark agreement—the first among governments to manage the emissions growth of an entire global industrial sector—aims to cap net emissions with carbon neutral growth from 2020. ""Aviation is at the forefront of industries in managing its carbon footprint. Along with offsetting emissions through CORSIA, airlines are working with partners in industry and government to advance technology, improve operations and generate more efficiencies in infrastructure,"" said de Juniac.

The five fastest-growing markets in terms of additional passengers per year over the forecast period will be

The top ten fastest-growing markets in percentage terms will be in Africa: Sierra Leone, Guinea, Central African Republic, Benin, Mali, Rwanda, Togo, Uganda, Zambia and Madagascar. Each of these markets is expected to grow by more than 8% each year on average over the next 20 years, doubling in size each decade.",air-traffic

"Federal Aviation Administrator (FAA) Michael Huerta today joined federal and local officials to dedicate the new air traffic control facility at McCarran International Airport.

The project includes a 352-foot tall air traffic control tower and a 59,000 square-foot base building, which houses the Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON), air traffic control training simulators, administrative offices, and equipment.

“This project fulfills our core mandate of providing the traveling public with the world-class air transportation system that they expect and deserve,” said U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx.  “It also provided a shot in the arm to the local economy by putting Nevadans to work in well-paying construction jobs.”

“It’s critical for us to reinvest in our infrastructure to ensure that we have the safest, most efficient, and most competitive air transportation system possible,” said Huerta.  “This modernized tower and TRACON provides our controllers with vastly improved working environments that reflect the bustling airport and airspace that they serve.”

“McCarran International is one of the nation’s busiest airports, and I’m very grateful that the FAA has completed this state-of-the-art project that will serve worldwide travelers for decades to come.  Controllers now enjoy greater visibility and access to their equipment, and the expanded TRACON is capable of handling far more positions than was possible before,” said Rosemary Vassiliadis, Director of Aviation for Clark County, Nevada.  “We’re growing at McCarran, and the FAA has shown it’s committed to supporting that growth.”

A taller tower was needed to provide controllers with better airfield views, and the new tower is the second-tallest in the country.  The old tower, which the FAA started using in 1983, was about 200 feet tall.

McCarran’s air traffic also has increased dramatically since the old facility was built, creating a need for more controller space in both the tower and TRACON.  The airport served about 140,000 flights in 1983.  Last year, it handled about 525,000 flights, making it the nation’s seventh-busiest commercial airport.

The new tower’s controller work area, known as the cab, is 850 square feet – more than 50 percent larger than the old facility.

The cab’s unique design consists of two levels.  Ground controllers, who handle aircraft between the terminals and runways, are located on the lower deck, closer to the airport surface.  Local controllers, who handle arriving and departing aircraft and aircraft on the runways, sit in the raised area, which enables them to better coordinate with one another by enabling more direct communication.  Equipment is mounted on moveable arms, which allows each controller to adjust it to suit his or her needs.

The 2,100 square-foot TRACON is more than twice the size of the old one.  It can accommodate up to 20 air traffic control positions – four more than in the old building.

The tower and TRACON both have state-of-the-art information displays that integrate systems displaying traffic, weather, and radar data into one workstation.  Touch-screen technology allows controllers to move easily between the different screens.

The building features a white membrane roof to reflect heat away from the structure, paints and wood that emit low amounts of Volatile Organic Compounds, energy-efficient lighting, low-flow water fixtures, and low-water landscaping.

The control tower handles air traffic on the airport surface and in the airspace within a five-mile mile radius of McCarran, up to an altitude of 3,000 feet.  The TRACON handles airborne aircraft within about a 35-mile radius of McCarran, up to 19,000 feet in altitude.

The total project cost – including the building construction, installation of air traffic control equipment, electronics, and electrical and mechanical systems – was about $111 million.",air-traffic
"The FAA and General Aviation (GA) group’s #FlySafe national safety campaign aims to educate the GA community about best practices in calculating and predicting aircraft performance, and operating within established aircraft limitations.

In 2015, the FAA introduced a Compliance Philosophy that embraces self-disclosure of errors. A “just culture” allows for due consideration of honest mistakes. But, even unintentional errors can have a serious impact on safety, so we ensure that the underlying safety concern is always addressed.

Our goal is to identify safety issues and correct them as effectively, quickly and efficiently as possible. Our view of compliance stresses a problem-solving approach, which includes root-cause analysis, transparency and information exchange. The goal is to improve the safety performance of all involved.

The FAA’s compliance philosophy emphasizes “Compliance Action” where appropriate. Compliance Action is the FAA’s method for correcting unintentional deviations that come from flawed systems and procedures, simple mistakes, lack of understanding or diminished skills. The FAA believes that these types of deviations are best corrected through root cause analysis and training, education or other appropriate improvements to procedures or training programs. Examples of Compliance Actions include on-the-spot corrections, counseling, and additional training (including remedial training).

A Compliance Action is not a finding of violation. Rather, it is an open and transparent exchange of safety information between you and the FAA. Its only purpose is to restore compliance and correct the underlying causes that led to the deviation.

Generally, if you are qualified, as well as willing and able to cooperate, the FAA will resolve the issue with compliance tools, techniques, concepts and programs. However, an airman who indicates that he or she is unwilling or unable to comply, or shows evidence of intentional deviation, reckless or criminal behavior, or other significant safety risk would be ineligible for Compliance Action.

The FAA expects compliance. Our approach to oversight does not mean that we’re going to go easy on compliance. The FAA will continue to use enforcement action when needed. The FAA will maintain strict accountability for inappropriate risk-taking behaviors, and will have zero tolerance for intentional or reckless behavior.

However, the FAA will not use enforcement as the first tool in the toolbox. In all cases, the goal of the FAA Compliance Philosophy is to achieve rapid compliance, to eliminate a safety risk or deviation, and to ensure positive and permanent change.

The goal of the compliance philosophy is to create an open, problem-solving approach to allow safety problems to be understood through proactive exchange of information and effective compliance. Through increased sharing of safety data, we can better identify emerging hazards and predict aviation risks, including many of those that may contribute or directly lead to a loss of control situation.

The FAA may use the information collected to support col­laborative government and industry initiatives, build courses on FAASafety.gov, and support training that other safety organizations provide. The agency may also promote information via safety forums and online or printed articles. This exchange is crucial to adequately identify and address the hazards and risk in our activities.

Voluntary safety efforts such as the Commercial Aviation Safety Team (CAST), General Aviation Joint Steering Committee (GAJSC), Aviation Safety Information and Sharing (ASIAS), Aviation Safety Action Program (ASAP), and Air Traffic Safety Action Program (ATSAP) have demonstrated the benefits of this non-punitive, problem solving, collaborative approach to solving safety problems. In fact, the FAA and industry are now beginning the work of the Unmanned Aircraft Safety Team.

Anyone can report a safety-related concern to Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) through the Electronic Report Submission page or by downloading, printing and submitting a report via U.S. Mail.

The Compliance Philosophy is part of the FAA’s Risk-Based Decision Making initiative, and uses consistent data-informed approaches to enable the FAA to make smarter, risk-based decisions. This engaged, solution-oriented, outcome-based approach reduces risk in the National Airspace System. It has helped industry and the FAA produce technological advances, training initiatives, and messaging designed to reduce accidents resulting from losing control of an aircraft.

The FAA wants to work with you to identify and fix the root causes of a deviation. In all cases, we investigate the matter with public safety in mind. Working together, we have achieved a safety record that is unmatched. We must continue to set the gold standard when it comes to safety.

What is Loss of Control?

A Loss of Control (LOC) accident involves an unintended departure of an aircraft from controlled flight. LOC can happen because the aircraft enters a flight regime that is outside its normal flight envelope and may quickly develop into a stall or spin. It can introduce an element of surprise for the pilot.

The FAA and industry are working together to prevent Loss of Control accidents and save lives. You can help make a difference by joining our Fly Safe campaign. Each month on FAA.gov, we’re providing pilots with a Loss of Control solution developed by a team of experts. They have studied the data and developed solutions – some of which are already reducing risk. We hope you will join us in this effort and spread the word. Follow #FlySafe on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. I know that we can reduce these accidents by working together as a community.",air-traffic
"SESAR Deployment Manager (SDM) has been mandated by the European Commission (EC) to act as Data Link Services (DLS) Implementation Project Manager.

By this mandate, EC aims to implement one of the key recommendations in the DLS study delivered by the SESAR Joint Undertaking in July 2016 (ELSA) to “empower a pan-European air/ground datalink implementing function having appropriate steering responsibilities”. In addition to its roles of Deployment Manager and Coordinator of the Framework Partnership to deploy SESAR, SDM will also act as architect for DLS implementation in Europe.

It is SDM ambition to use its legacy functions to make its new role effective, inclusive and supportive to all stakeholders required to implement DLS in Europe in accordance with the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 2015/310.

EC’s mandate to SDM refers to the Data Link Services (DLS) Recovery Plan that the SDM developed on the basis of the “DLS Implementation Strategy towards Initial Trajectory Information Sharing” with the support of all operational stakeholders and included into the Deployment Programme 2016 just released to EC.

The DLS Recovery Plan aims to set a realistic path from today’s DLS implementation status in Europe up to Initial Trajectory Information Sharing (AF6) implementation by the deadlines set in the Pilot Common Project (1st January 2025 for ground and 1st January 2026 for the airborne segment).

The “DLS Recovery Plan” is also one of the reference for applicants to the 2016 CEF call for proposals published on 13th October 2016.

“I wish to thank European Commission to further show trust on us. Data Link represents a real cornerstone for the future of the European Air Traffic Management

"NRG Systems, a global leader in the distribution and service of atmospheric remote sensing solutions, has announced today the U.S. launch of advanced, Lidar-based remote sensing solutions, introducingpowerful new ways to resolve some of the most critical weather hazard challenges facing the aviation industry. Thanks to theirability to detect low-level wind hazards through real-time wind reconstruction, Lidars have become an essential tool in managing wind shear, microburst, and wake turbulence events, leading to improved safety and performance in the aviation sector.

This Lidar technology, called WINDCUBE®, provides highly resolved volumetric observations of the terminal airspace, offering actionable intelligence that ensures safer take-off and approach, and boosts the overall efficiency of air traffic management. It significantly improves hazard risk detection for terminal operations, and synergizes seamlessly with complementary remote sensing technologies.

“Global air traffic is expected to double in the next two decades, along with an increasing demand for improved safety and performance. The ability of airport operators to detect low level wind shear, gust fronts, microbursts, and other wind hazards, in real-time, has never been more important to commercial aviation,” commented Paul Drewniak, a meteorological industry expert with over 20 years of experience in the field, who was recently recruited to head NRG’s new Lidar Meteorology Solutions business unit.

The sustainable growth of air traffic requires the enhancement of weather information and its integration into air traffic management (ATM) processes. Programs such as NextGEN in the U.S. and SESAR in Europe aim to modernize ATM, improve situational awareness, and increase airspace capacity. WINDCUBE® Lidar and Selex ES Rainbow5 solutions integrate real-time wind hazard detection capabilities for single or multi-runway configurations, providing improved traffic management and safety.

WINDCUBE® Lidar solutions are designed and manufactured by French technology firm LEOSPHERE, and exclusively distributed in the United States by NRG Systems. In SESAR-sponsored European projects at Charles de Gaulle, Nice, Toulouse-Blagnac, and Braunschweig airports, WINDCUBE® Lidar has demonstrated capabilities to measure winds up to 10 km with an accuracy better than 0.5m/s, retrieve 1-minute glide path winds, reconstruct volumetric terminal wind data every 5 minutes, and provide multi-sensor data fusion with effective new remote sensors.",air-traffic
"FAA Administrator Michael Huerta joined local officials today in dedicating the new, environmentally friendly airport traffic control tower at San Francisco International Airport (SFO).

Rising up in a graceful flare, the new tower is 221 feet tall. The 650 square-foot controller work area gives air traffic controllers unobstructed 235-degree views of SFO’s runways and taxiways.

Under a unique partnership, the FAA and SFO shared the cost of the project. The FAA paid for the costs associated with building the tower itself. SFO paid for the costs associated with integrating the tower into the existing airport complex, as well as the facility’s striking design features. SFO also supervised the design and construction work.

“This project created an iconic, modern tower that provides critical safety benefits for the tens of millions of people who pass through this airport each year,” said U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx. “In addition, it put many Bay Area residents to work in well-paying jobs – more than 2,000 workers contributed more than 500,000 labor hours to this project.”

“Completing this key infrastructure investment required a true collaboration between the FAA and SFO,” said FAA Administrator Michael Huerta. “The end product reflects not only our passion for safety, but also our shared belief that investment and environmental responsibility are intertwined. This project is a shining example of our efforts to minimize our environmental footprint.”

“San Francisco is a City of Innovation, and the new airport traffic control tower at SFO reflects this spirit,” said San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee. “Seismically sound, environmentally sustainable, and iconic in design, this new facility is truly a beacon for our gateway to the world.”

“This new airport traffic control tower stands as a tribute to our partnership with the FAA,” said Airport Director Ivar C. Satero. “This project represents the first-ever collaboration of its kind between an airport and the FAA to construct a new tower. The result is a masterpiece, replete with cutting-edge safety engineering, advanced technology, and the visual dynamism to represent SFO for decades to come. I truly appreciate the vision, dedication, and teamwork that made this exceptional facility possible.”

The new tower was necessary because the old tower did not meet current seismic standards, and retrofitting the 32 year-old building was not feasible. The new tower is designed to withstand a magnitude 8.0 earthquake.

Located between Terminals 1 and 2, the tower features a 147 foot-tall ribbon of glass running down the middle of the structure. The glass reflects sunlight during the day and is illuminated by interior lighting at night.

The project also includes a three-story, 44,000 square-foot base building, which houses administrative offices, computer equipment, a backup generator, and secure corridors that allow passengers to transit between terminals without affording access to the tower.

New air traffic control equipment in the controller work area includes a state-of-the-art ground radar system and touch-screen displays for weather and airfield status information. By the end of the year, the ground radar will link to Runway Status Lights, which are similar to stop lights that tell pilots when it is unsafe to enter a runway or to take off.

A host of green environmental features earned the project LEED Gold status from the U.S. Green Building Council. These include solar panels installed on a nearby building roof; natural daylight in offices and the public lobby; a roof garden and reflective roofing, which reduce heat gain from the roof; low-flow plumbing fixtures; recycled building materials; an electric vehicle charging station; and energy efficient mechanical and electrical equipment.

The FAA’s share of the project cost was about $82 million. SFO’s share was about $69 million for integrating the tower into the existing airport complex, which included the materials for the building facade and the exterior LED lighting array.

Construction on the new tower began in June 2012. The FAA will start using the facility on October 15, 2016.

SFO was the nation’s 11th busiest airport in 2015 with about 430,000 takeoffs and landings.",air-traffic
"At the end of September, about 40 representatives of all FABEC air navigation service providers (ANSP), their social partners and national supervisory authorities met in Lyon for the first FABEC Safety and Social Dialogue Conference. A wide range of topics were discussed, including tangible activities that can be undertaken to improve safety in operations at individual locations as well as more structural measures such as audits and EASA activities. The conference was rounded off by the increasingly important topic of cybersecurity.

During the discussion, the following core areas were identified. All participants agreed that compliance alone– is not sufficient. Furthermore, safety is not just the responsibility of safety experts, it is the core task of all employees of an ANSP. Current regulatory provisions do not reflect this aspect sufficiently. This is why the excellent performance of the ANSPs in this performance area ought to receive more attention. In addition, it has to be considered that technological advances will entail new safety requirements for the aviation industry as a whole. Follow-up activities to the topics covered at the conference will now be developed at both the international and local level.

"The new ‘Capital Express’ service between Singapore, Canberra and Wellington has today been unveiled as the newest addition to the Asia South Pacific Initiative to Reduce Emissions (ASPIRE) programme.

Airservices Australia, Singapore Airlines, the Civil Aviation Authority Singapore (CAAS), and Airways New Zealand today announced that all SQ291 and SQ292 flights will be as environmentally friendly as possible through the utilisation of a range of ASPIRE practices, including:

The ASPIRE programme is a partnership between six air navigation agencies and ten partner airlines, focused on reducing the environmental impact of aviation through operational means across Asia and the Pacific.

Under the ASPIRE programme, the inaugural ‘Capital Express’ flights on 20 and 21 September saved almost 7,000 kg of fuel across the four sectors, which equates to an approximate saving of around 22,000 kg of carbon emissions.

The results were achieved by using 25 of a possible 32 efficient flight operations and air traffic management practices on all four sectors of the new service.

It is expected that over the course of a year the ASPIRE programme will help the ‘Capital Express’ flights save around 1.5 million kilograms of fuel and 4.6 million kilograms of carbon emissions, which is the equivalent of taking approximately 970 cars off the road.

The new ‘Capital Express’ service has also been declared an ASPIRE Daily City Pair, achieving a four-plus star rating, out of a maximum of five possible stars.

Airservices Executive General Manager Air Navigation Services, Stephen Angus said the new ASPIRE Daily City Pairs are the result of the collaborative efforts of Airservices Australia, Canberra Airport, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS), Airways New Zealand, Singapore Airlines, Changi Airport Group and Wellington International Airport.

“The new Singapore–Canberra–Wellington route is another excellent example of airlines, airports and air navigation agencies working together to reduce aviation greenhouse gas emissions globally,” Mr Angus said.

Director-General of CAAS, Mr Kevin Shum, said “CAAS has been an active participant of the ASPIRE programme since 2010.”

“We are delighted that the programme continues to grow and make impactful progress,” Mr Shum said.

“CAAS and our ASPIRE partners are committed to achieve sustainable aviation growth in the Asia Pacific region. By working closely together and adopting best practices in air navigation, we can enhance air transport operations and reduce aviation emissions.”

Airways Head of Auckland Operations Tim Boyle says the flight is another great example of the progress being made towards sustainability in aviation.

“For New Zealand, issues of our distance and emissions are particularly relevant and this has driven a commitment from Airways to do all it can to work towards improved sustainability.

“Collaboration with industry partners through programmes like ASPIRE is assisting us in achieving this goal.”

Singapore Airlines Ag Senior Vice President Flight Operations, Captain CE Quay said the addition of the new ‘Capital Express’ service to the ASPIRE programme was an excellent example of Singapore Airlines’ commitment to protecting the environment.

“We believe we have a long-term responsibility to help protect the environment, which is why we have programmes in place to ensure that sustainable practices are implemented across the Company,” Captain Quay said.

“We constantly ensure that our operations are carried out in a responsible manner through a framework designed to manage issues related to carbon emissions, waste, noise and the consumption of energy and resources. We are pleased to have added our new Singapore – Canberra – Wellington flights to the successful ASPIRE programme and thank our partners for helping make it possible.”

Since its establishment in 2008, ASPIRE partner airlines and air navigation agencies have implemented 30 new ASPIRE Daily city pairs across the Asia Pacific region, helping the airline industry save millions of dollars in fuel and thousands of tonnes of carbon dioxide.

Singapore Airlines was the first to fly a multi-sector demonstration green flight in 2010 when SQ11 flew from Singapore to Los Angeles, via Tokyo saving 10,686 kg of fuel as well as 33,769 kg of carbon emissions.",air-traffic

"Air traffic management and control and airport systems and security are at the heart of Leonardo-Finmeccanica’s offer in the airport air side and land side domain. In the occasion of Inter airport and ATC Global, both taking place in Beijing from 12th to 14th September, these capabilities have been showcased in China, where Leonardo has a leading role with its civil systems and solutions.

Leonardo’s ATC systems in China and around the world

Leonardo supplies ATC systems to China, where the company has provided over 60 radar systems which ensure radar coverage of nearly all the major air traffic routes over the central and eastern regions of China. In the country the company also provides maintenance, services, logistics support and upgrade work for existing systems. The company boasts a worldwide presence from Asia to America.

For instance the new airport in Doha, Qatar (HIA - Hamad International Airport), along with the Kingdom of Bahrain’s main airport are both being equipped with Leonardo’s air traffic control systems. The company’s ATM systems are also operational in Malaysia, at Vietnam’s Hanoi airport and Bulgaria’s Sofia Airport. In Saudi Arabia, both Jeddah and Riyadh airports are already operating Finmeccanica ATC systems. In Kuwait, a recent contract will see Leonardo supply and install a complex suite of equipment that will manage the data traffic between the airport’s existing systems. In 2016, Leonardo made operational one of the world’s most complex ATM systems, Turkey’s SMART project (Systematic Modernisation of ATM Resources Turkey), which manages all of the country’s air traffic.

In India, the company supplied ATC equipment for Bangalore and Hyderabad airports. In 2016/2017, Singapore’s Changi Airport will begin operating one of Leonardo’s terminal approach radars. In Canada Leonardo was recently awarded a contract to supply the Canadian department for environmental policies and programs with 20 networked weather radars, with options up to additional 13 long range surveillance radar systems. Leonardo’s communications systems are installed in over 600 airports round the world. Leonardo is also helping define new standards for air traffic management systems, participating in major European programmes such as SESAR (Single European Sky ATM Research) the research and development programme aimed at the modernization of the European air traffic control.

Leonardo in the ATC domain: facts and figures

150 countries, trust Leonardo’s air traffic control systems. With over 50 years of experience, Leonardo has developed, manufactured and installed more than 300 air traffic management and control centres. The company has also provided more than 80 simulators, providing advanced air traffic control training worldwide. More than 700 primary and secondary surveillance radars (including Mode S which allows an advanced surveillance capability for secondary radar systems) have also been sold, with more than 2000 operator stations and 1000 navigation systems.

Helping manage the effects of weather on flights, Leonardo has provided more than 160 weather radars and over 40 automated weather observation systems.

For over 50 years Leonardo has been a leading international solution provider of sorting systems for letters, flats & packets with a continuous evolution of its products expanding to handling baggage and parcels. A series of innovations and improvements position the MBHS (Multi-Sorting Baggage Handling System based on a consolidated cross-belt handling proprietary technology) as one of the most advanced, high-performance baggage handling systems on the market. Some of the key benefits, adding value to its customers, include very high sorting throughput with ultimate precision, significant energy savings, very low maintenance, extremely high reliability, availability and configurability, which ensures lowest life cycle costs. The innovative technology ensures optimum and gentle handling for all types of baggage including that are fragile, have high friction or sticky surfaces, have prominent wheels or are irregular in shape, thereby enhancing passenger experience.

Leonardo’s baggage handling systems are successfully in operation in several European airports. Among them the most significant are: Rome Fiumicino in Italy, Geneve in Switzerland, Auroairport (Basel CH, Mulhouse F, Freiburg D) and Paris Orly. Systems are also currently in deployment in Islamabad (Pakistan) and Lyon (France). In Rome Fiumicino, moreover, two new huge baggage handling systems are in the last phases of activation: one is dedicated to the new Alitalia Etihad Terminal and the second to the new International Terminal.

The first can be considered a real “giant” among the BHS systems: the complete system will be nine kilometers long, covering a 25,000 sqm area, including three cross belt sorters (for a total sorter length of about 1100 m) and it can easily reach, and exceed, the overall capacity of 6000 baggage per hour, required by Aeroporti di Roma, the Italian company in charge of the two international Rome airports management, thanks to the capacity of each sorter of more than 8000 baggage per hour. The first lot of this system has been activated six months ahead schedule since July 2016 helping the main Italian international airport face the boom of passengers during the summer; the second lot will be in operation at the end of 2016.

The system dedicated to the International Terminal includes two cross belt sorters (for a total length of about 960 m) and a total of more than 7 km of conveyors.

Leonardo’s cross-belt baggage sorter MBHS helped Aeroporti di Roma to be awarded the Baggage Improvement Program certificate by IATA and allowed a decrease of over 60% in the number of mishandled bags.

Innovative and proprietary solutions support security officers during their activities inside and outside the airport, while being connected with the Leonardo’s security platform solution enhance the safety and security. The platform, suitable for all types of airports, whether small or large and complex, civilian or military, is able to manage the security of all the inside and outside airport areas, activating dedicated and configurable workflows.

"The SESAR Joint Undertaking (SESAR JU) and the European Space Agency (ESA) have signed a memorandum of cooperation (MoC) to further facilitate the development of satellite-based communications for Europe’s air transport system. The MoC was signed by Florian Guillermet, Executive Director of the SESAR JU, and Magali Vaissiere, ESA Director for Telecommunications and Integrated Applications, during a signing ceremony in Paris.

  

 Building on existing working arrangements, the agreement commits both organisations to identify synergies and key milestones in their respective technical programmes.  The cooperation will focus on the development of SESAR Solutions involving avionics, the SESAR integrated communication, navigation and surveillance (CNS) strategy and the European ATM Master Plan – the roadmap for modernising air traffic management.

 

 The agreement specifically makes provisions to ensure that the evolution of the ESA Iris Precursor and its future capabilities meets the needs of air traffic management. By 2018, Iris Precursor will provide air–ground communications for initial ‘4D’ trajectory exchanges, providing the intended track of an aircraft in four dimensions: latitude, longitude, altitude and time. By 2028 datalink will become the primary means of communications between controllers and cockpit crews and it is expected that Iris will enable the set of datalink applications defined by SESAR including full 4D trajectory-based operations capabilities.

 

 “The close cooperation between ESA and the SESAR Joint Undertaking lays the foundations for a smooth transition to satellite-based air-ground communications for future Air Traffic Management,” said Magali Vaissiere, Director for Telecommunications and Integrated Applications, European Space Agency.

 

 “Satellite communications is a cornerstone of the future air transport system. This cooperation agreement with the European Space Agency will enable us to forge ahead with our ATM modernisation plans, ensuring the foreseen cost and operational efficient approach to air-ground communications,” said Florian Guillermet, Executive Director, SESAR Joint Undertaking.",air-traffic

"The European Commission recommends two Air Traffic Management (ATM) development projects – elaborated by HungaroControl’s experts – for funding.  One project aims to extend Free Route Airspace (FRA) across European borders, the other aims to support the safe and efficient flow of aircraft arriving at Vienna airport while in the Hungarian airspace.

HungaroControl submitted its proposals with the professional support of the Ministry of National Development. The total budget for the two projects amounts to EUR 3.1 million, 85% of which (more than EUR 2.6 million) is co-financed by the European Union’s Connecting Europe Facility (CEF).

One project recommended for funding is an extension to the FRA (Free Route Airspace) feasibility study, co-financed in 2015. This will enable MATIAS (HungaroControl’s air traffic management system) to handle cross-border Free Route Airspace and thus to support the introduction of extended cross-border Free Route Airspace in selected FAB CE (Functional Airspace Block Central Europe) countries. The project also aims to upgrade MATIAS’ FDP (Flight Data Processing) functionality to make the system capable of supporting flexible airspace planning and use – as this is a pre-requisite to introducing cross-border Free Route Airspace.

The other project recommended for funding by the European Commission aims to upgrade MATIAS by adding new functionality to support the safe and efficient flow of aircraft arriving at Vienna airport in the Hungarian airspace. The objective of the project is to support the AMAN (Arrival Management) system serving Vienna airport by adding AMAN and E-AMAN (Extended AMAN) functionality to the MATIAS system. This project will be accomplished by a consortium led by the Austrian air navigation service provider (ANSP), with HungaroControl and the Czech and Slovak ANSPs as further participants.",air-traffic
"Aireon LLC and FlightAware today announced a new partnership and the launch of GlobalBeaconSM, a solution providing airlines with 100 percent global flight tracking.  GlobalBeacon is designed to ensure airlines are in compliance with Global Aeronautical Distress Safety System (GADSS) recommendations and requirements.  Announced by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in March of 2016, GADSS was created largely in response to the disappearance of MH370, and is designed to help prevent the loss of commercial aircraft in distress over remote locations.  GlobalBeacon will provide airlines with minute-by-minute, global tracking of Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B) equipped aircraft by 2018.

At the heart of GlobalBeacon’s capability is a combination of data from Aireon’s space-based ADS-B aircraft surveillance network, due to be operational by 2018, and FlightAware’s flight tracking web interface and worldwide flight tracking data – including origin, destination, flight plan route, position, and estimated time of arrival. When implemented, airlines will be instantly equipped to meet or exceed GADSS requirements and recommendations, with no new avionics required.

The core of the GADSS recommendations and requirements stipulate that aircraft report their position to their airline operations center no less than once every 15 minutes.  Should an aircraft become in distress, however, position reports then must be provided every minute.  GlobalBeacon will provide a permanent, real-time reporting capability, far exceeding the ICAO recommendation.  Implementation of GADSS provisions is expected by 2018.

“GlobalBeacon was created to help solve an important problem that has bedeviled the aviation industry since commercial flight began, and together Aireon and FlightAware are proud to offer a true solution,” said Aireon CEO, Don Thoma. “No other product can provide 100 percent global tracking, in real-time, without the cost of additional avionics equipage. We’ve already seen significant interest from airlines in this solution, and you can expect to hear a big announcement on that front in the coming days.”

In addition to aircraft location reporting, GADSS also requires aircraft to provide immediate notification of abnormal events, regardless of air traffic control regions and without sacrificing baseline search and rescue services.   Other products may require additional equipment and for airlines to create and implement new distress activation procedures in the cockpit and on the ground.  However, GlobalBeacon will offer a comprehensive one-size-fits-all global flight tracking solution for ADS-B equipped aircraft with no new required infrastructure, either in the air or on the ground.  Further, existing FlightAware customers can seamlessly integrate GlobalBeacon with their current services.

GlobalBeacon will provide airlines with a web-based, real-time aircraft tracking dashboard that features configurable alerts, providing immediate notification of abnormal events.  Should an aircraft deviate from its intended flight path, experience severe turbulence or stop transmitting location, the aircraft will automatically enter distressed status and immediately notify its airline operations center, who can take appropriate actions.

“With GlobalBeacon, airlines will have a single GADSS solution for all of their aircraft,” said FlightAware CEO, Daniel Baker.  “Combining FlightAware’s vast airline flight tracking data with Aireon’s global space-based ADS-B surveillance capabilities will create the first 100 percent global solution for this difficult problem. The industry is about to take a tremendous technological leap forward in the name of safety, and we’re proud to lead the way.”

FlightAware will also be integrating Aireon’s space-based ADS-B surveillance data with its existing products including FlightAware Global and FlightAware Firehose, currently used by thousands of customers to track their aircraft.  FlightAware Global provides real-time air traffic control data and RADAR data for flights to, from and within more than 55 countries.  The addition of Aireon’s capabilities will provide FlightAware Global with 100 percent global coverage.  FlightAware Firehose provides a secure streaming data feed of flight positions and flight status data via a combination of worldwide air traffic control data, ADS-B, and aircraft datalink information.

Aireon’s space-based ADS-B service will be operational in 2018, shortly after the completion of the Iridium NEXT satellite constellation. The constellation will consist of 66 operational low-earth-orbit satellites providing 100 percent global coverage.  The service will also provide Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs) with global aircraft surveillance capability, and is expected to help reduce fuel costs, increase safety and enable more efficient flight paths.",air-traffic
"Comsoft Solutions’ state-of-the-art Surveillance Data Distribution System (SDDS-NG) is being deployed for German ANSP, DFS, to enable the advanced exchange of surveillance data over an IP-based network while still supporting the legacy serial lines used to interface existing radar systems.

DFS entire Surveillance Data Network is centrally managed by Comsoft Solutions Network System Management and Control (NSMC) systems, thus enabling DFS to gain further efficiency in the management of the surveillance data network, deployed throughout Germany, by pooling system expertise.

More than three million aircraft take off from, land on, or fly over German territory each year, and the network of eight SDDS-NG systems, located at four German Air Traffic Control centres in Karlsruhe, Munich, Langen near Frankfurt and Bremen, will be of considerable benefit to German ATC.

DFS SDDS-NG network will become fully operational at all sites in 2017, thus ensuring a smooth transition from the current RADNET, built on RMCDE network nodes, which will not be supported after the end of 2017. As a result, the operational capability of DFS will not be at risk when the DFS end-of-life RMCDE nodes are decommissioned.

SDDS-NG facilitates a uniform connection of all surveillance sensors using the ASTERIX standard and was designed and developed to cover complete surveillance requirements, while complying with the latest safety standards. SDDS-NG is already operational at the Brazilian Airforce (Força Aérea Brasileira - FAB) on 22 radar sites, in Iceland within the system deployments of Quadrant and EUROCONTROL’s ARTAS and in Indonesia and Abu Dhabi in the scope of the Prisma ATM systems. The SDDS-NG installations in Estonia (EANS) and Portugal (NAV Portugal) have been completed by Comsoft Solutions and are expected to be taken into operation by the respective ANSPs within the next months.",air-traffic

"Rocket Lab has passed a significant milestone in its launch preparations after agreeing with Airways New Zealand how the air navigation service provider will safely support regular rocket launches through New Zealand airspace.

Airways has signed a contract with Rocket Lab to provide air traffic services for its test and commercial rocket launches from the world’s first private orbital launch site on Mahia Peninsula.

Airways’ Chief Operating Officer Pauline Lamb says the organisation has been working with Rocket Lab for 18 months as it prepares to make history with the launch of its Electron rocket from New Zealand.

“A ’special use airspace’ will be created around the Electron rocket as it launches through New Zealand airspace. Our air traffic controllers will protect this airspace from other aircraft using airspace separation procedures, and will do all they can to minimise the impact the launch operations may have on other airspace users,” Ms Lamb says.

“Allowing safe and flexible access to our airspace will be an important factor in supporting this emerging industry in New Zealand, and Airways is committed to enabling this.”

Rocket Lab has developed its own commercial launch facility on Mahia Peninsula and plans to deliver commercial payloads into space with up to 100 launches per year.

“We look forward to working with Airways, who continue to play an important role in ensuring New Zealand’s growing aerospace industry is safe and well-coordinated with all aviation activity,” says Rocket Lab CEO Peter Beck.

Airways is in a strong position to be working with Rocket Lab as it embarks on rocket launches into space from New Zealand. The air traffic control provider has already enabled around 120 near-space launches through New Zealand airspace. Organisations such as NASA and Google have chosen New Zealand for their balloon launches due to our relatively uncongested airspace, Airways’ experience and robust systems and procedures, and a national appetite to support emerging technology.

“It’s great to see a New Zealand founded organisation taking a world-leading role in the rocket technology sector. While working alongside Rocket Lab to enable their launches, at the same time we’re helping to position New Zealand as the ideal place to access space from,” Ms Lamb says.",air-traffic

The system features advanced redundant capability including complete flight plan fallback processing and flight plan synchronization, as well as multi-sensor processing and alerting to enable consistent operations during any main system outage or maintenance period.

The airports’ and airspace traffic flows will be sequenced and balanced using MAESTRO, Thales’s fully integrated arrival and departure management system. MAESTRO will provide seamless integration between area control, approach control and tower systems – so all controllers will share the same sequence information and can manage airport configuration changes collaboratively, including Advanced Traffic Flow Management (ATFM) control times. 



Additionally, it will support the integration of required arrival delay absorption into sector displays to enable efficient traffic sequencing and reduced airborne holding. Further, advanced runway allocation processing will enable efficient airline operations and reduce taxi times.



This latest modernization project will be completed in 2019. The project is an extension of Thales’s commitment to partnering with the ATMB to create China’s next generation Air Traffic Control (ATC) system. China uses Thales ATC systems to manage 60% of the country's air traffic. As the largest air traffic management supplier in China, Thales has deployed 39 radar systems, 11 ATC automation systems (including 5 provided by BEST), and more than 550 Navaids, as well as Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) and multilateration systems.",air-traffic
"The companies that provide air navigation services across Africa have committed to a joint initiative to improve aviation safety across the continent.

Members of CANSO – the Civil Air Navigation Services Organisation – have signed a declaration to address critical safety issues in air traffic management (ATM). The Declaration on the Africa ATM Safety Peer Review Initiative commits air navigation service providers (ANSPs) to form teams to conduct peer reviews of each other’s safety management systems, with CANSO coordinating the initiative and providing expert guidance.

Speaking at the CANSO Africa Conference in Accra, Ghana, CANSO Director General Jeff Poole said: “Safety is our number one priority and the Africa ATM Safety Peer Review Initiative will further enhance safety in air traffic management in the region. This initiative is a significant milestone and a great example of partnership in action as ANSPs work with each other, as well as aviation industry partners, to implement effective safety management systems.”

The participating ANSPs will form teams and visit each team member to conduct peer reviews. They will assess and evaluate the implementation of safety management systems (SMS) by each participating ANSP – based on the CANSO Standard of Excellence in Safety Management Systems and other safety materials produced by CANSO and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) – and identify specific areas for improvement.

The initiative will enable participating ANSPs to standardise the elements of their safety management systems, thus facilitating enhanced data analysis, safety risk management and performance measurement, which are key enablers for higher overall levels of safety performance.

The results will allow ANSPs to determine the maturity levels of their safety management systems and communicate these to the satisfaction of ICAO and ANSP regulators, in turn reducing the need for regulator assessments and/or ICAO audits.

Poole concluded, “All parts of the aviation industry are working hard to improve safety in Africa. This initiative will support continuous overall improvement in ATM and aviation safety in Africa in a consistent, measurable and sustainable manner. I am delighted that CANSO Members in Africa have signed this declaration, and I urge all ANSPs in Africa to embrace the initiative and make Africa’s skies safer.”",air-traffic
"The German air navigation service provider DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung continues to expand its sales and consulting business for air navigation services. In January 2016, DFS opened a new office in Singapore to be followed by another regional office in Beijing at the end of this year.

""Our sales and consulting business contributes to the development of our company,"" stated Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, Chairman and CEO of DFS. DFS will be much closer to its customers and establish an even higher presence in these regions. Besides its core business of providing air navigation services in Germany, DFS has offered consulting and training services for more than 20 years and in addition has been selling its air traffic management systems around the globe.

Besides Europe, the key regions for the commercial business of DFS are Southeast Asia, China and the Middle East. Air transport in these non-European regions is experiencing above-average growth making it necessary for numerous countries to modernise the structures of their air navigation services. We are able to share our expertise in all aspects of modern air traffic control, including, for example, safety management and airspace restructuring,"" explained Scheurle.

The regional office in Singapore will be headed by Hans van der Meulen, who has more than 15 years experience as a DFS consultant. He has led and conducted many different projects in this region.

The Chinese market will be the focus of Dr Hans de Jong, a safety management and human factors expert who has worked in this field since 1999. In addition to safety management, his areas of expertise also include air traffic flow management and remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS).",air-traffic
"Compared to previous summers, the 2016 season has suffered an unprecedented amount of severe weather. Heavy thunderstorms have disrupted traffic flows and caused significant delays. Some cells have extended vertically to an altitude making it impossible to fly over them. To ensure the safety of passengers, departures have had to be postponed until the weather fronts have either dissipated or moved on. This means that passengers have had to wait on board for an hour or longer before finally taking off. The FABEC air navigation service providers have addressed this problem and worked out concrete solutions.

In cooperation with the control centers in Langen, Karlsruhe, Zurich, Marseille and Padua, the Munich control center has designed re-routings to avoid thunderstorm cells. It is, for example, not possible to fly a direct route from Munich to Madrid if there is a storm cell above Lake Constance. In this situation, the air navigation services offer the airline dispatch an alternative route that leads south via Italy and then to the west towards Spain. The airline can decide whether to use this alternative or not: would they prefer the longer flight path or a longer wait on the ground. At the moment, DFS has agreements on the implementation of this procedure with four airlines – Lufthansa, Condor, Lufthansa Cityline, and Air Berlin.

Based on the positive results in Munich, further alternative routes will be developed in the coming months involving traffic departing to the northeast and in a second step headed towards Munich. At the FABEC level, the results of this pilot project will be passed on to FABEC partners who will undertake further implementations taking their local circumstances into account.",air-traffic
"EGNOS Service Provider, ESSP and Esbjerg Airport have recently signed an EGNOS Working Agreement (EWA), as a key step for the implementation of EGNOS-based approach procedures. The agreement was signed on the 27th June 2016 by Anette Bendixen, Airport Manager and Thierry Racaud ESSP CEO.

The signature of an EGNOS Working Agreement, establishes the operational and legal framework to use the EGNOS Safety-of-Life Service as a navigation aid between the EGNOS Service Provider – ESSP - and the Airport / Navigation entity willing to use this service; and nowadays this EWA covers under SES framework the two EGNOS based procedures operational at Esbjerg airport (EKEB).

Thierry Racaud, ESSP CEO said “Nice welcome to Esbjerg airport; a new EGNOS stakeholder at European skies. Those EGNOS based approaches offer a higher degree of safety than the ones provided by the existing visual approach during low cloud base operation improving airports’ accessibility, especially in case of bad weather conditions.”

Anette Bendixen, Esbjerg Airport said “In order to prepare for better use of our airspace we are happy to have signed the EGNOS Working Agreement with ESSP. We hope, in the near future, to have the EGNOS-based approach procedures to replace our present CAT 1 ILS’s and believe the Agreement is a giant step in that direction”",air-traffic
"Micro Nav’s latest BEST software release, known simply as BEST 6, is being released in a controlled manner. Firstly, it has been used to upgrade one of its most eminent customers, and secondly has been used in the Factory Acceptance Test (FAT) for another.



 BEST 6’s first customer, The General Civil Aviation Authority of Abu Dhabi, this month became the first customer to move on to the BEST 6 software platform. This brings GCAA Abu Dhabi onto the main product line from their development branch with Micro Nav delivering fixes on top of the merged functionality. As a long-term support customer, GCAA Abu Dhabi will go on to benefit from all enhancements that are planned with BEST.



 Micro Nav’s Technical Director Tony Bushnell said, “The success of this merge with BEST 6, our most complete and fully-featured software release, is central to our continued desire for improving quality.

"In an international public tender run by the Danish Ministry of Defense, via the Danish Defense Acquisition and Logistics Organization (DALO), Indra has been awarded the contract to provide radars to support air traffic management at the country's Royal Air Force bases.

The company will provide three systems, each equipped with a primary radar (PSR) and a secondary radar (MSSR). These systems will bolster airspace surveillance and air operations at the Skrydstrup, Karup and Aalborg airfields.

Indra was the only company to meet the client's requirements, in a tender that saw the world's leading manufacturers compete with each other. The Indra PSR primary radar offers high operational ratios thanks to numerous features, including its ability to cross-select equipment from the main and backup chains in the event of element failure. Meanwhile, the secondary radar (Indra MSSR) is a mature and latest generation product that can operate in cluster mode, working in coordination with other radars to avoid repeatedly interrogating the same aircraft. This makes it highly effective in regions of high traffic density, such as in the north of Europe.

The contract sees the company extend its global leadership in civil aviation traffic to the military field. The company has deployed air traffic technology at 4,000 facilities in 160 countries, making it one of the world's leading radar providers.

In military air traffic management, Indra has run major projects such as providing mobile air traffic management systems to the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), ensuring that these military air traffic controllers have access to first-class airspace surveillance and air traffic control capabilities.

Indra has also strengthened its position in the north of Europe, a market that demands the most advanced technologies and where Indra has been a driving force behind infrastructure modernization in several countries. For example, Indra developed and deployed the systems that manage air traffic in the skies over Germany and Poland; it supplied air traffic management systems to Lithuania and Ukraine; it deployed, jointly with Alcatel-Lucent, the system used by Latvia to manage maritime traffic on the Baltic coast; provided communication systems to shipyards; and lead the development of the Eurofighter Simulator, among others. The company also has offices in Germany and Norway, with significant technological capabilities.",air-traffic
"The new European separation standard for aircraft wake turbulence - developed by EUROCONTROL and called European Wake Vortex Re-categorisation (RECAT-EU) - is now being used by air traffic control at Paris Charles de Gaulle (CDG). 24/7 operations started on 22 March 2016 for arrivals and departures of airborne aircraft at both Paris CDG and Le Bourget.

Paris CDG confirms that RECAT-EU heightens resilience and flexibility in separation provision. The airport authorities have seen no negative impact on controller workload, or any increase in the rate of wake encounter reports.

“RECAT-EU is highly beneficial in peak hours. It gives us more flexibility in traffic separation delivery and has a positive impact on go-arounds,” added Magali Kintzler, Paris CDG’s Air Traffic Control Manager.

To reach this milestone, France’s largest international airport needed to carry out a local safety case. This helped Paris CDG address the few system adaptations required for the proper operation of RECAT-EU. These are typically adaptation of the flight plan processing system for converting ICAO flight plan wake turbulence categories into local RECAT category codes, Flight Strips and Controller Surveillance HMI (human machine interface) updates to display RECAT category codes.

Air Traffic Controllers received specialised training to familiarise themselves with potential changes to their normal operations. Communication with pilots should not be affected as the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) phraseology of “HEAVY” and “SUPER” types remain the same in RECAT-EU. To support pilots’ awareness of RECAT-EU changes, the EUROCONTROL Training Institute (IANS) provides a helpful online tutorial.

RECAT-EU is the result of fruitful collaboration between EUROCONTROL and its stakeholders. It received a formal endorsement of its safety case from the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) in October 2014.

This new, more precise categorisation of aircraft splits the current International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) “HEAVY” and “MEDIUM” categories into ‘UPPER’ and ‘LOWER’ sub-categories. A new SUPER HEAVY category that fully integrates aircraft - such as the A380 - was also created.

The Network Manager's objective is to secure widespread deployment of RECAT-EU in order to deliver aggregate Network benefits in terms of efficiency, capacity and quicker recovery from adverse conditions.",air-traffic
"The International Air Transport Association (IATA) expressed optimism for an agreement on a Carbon Offset and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) when governments meet for the 39th Assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organization later this month.

The draft negotiating text for CORSIA, published on 2 September 2016, broadly aligns with the aviation industry’s call for a mandatory global carbon offset scheme as a tool to help manage the industry’s emissions as it pursues its goal of carbon-neutral growth. Instead of being mandatory from the start, however, the draft text defines a voluntary ""pilot and implementation"" period (2021-2027) after which participation would be mandatory for all eligible States (2027 onwards).

""I am optimistic that we are on the brink of a historic agreement—a first for an industry sector at the global level. The aviation industry would have preferred a more ambitious timeline than is currently outlined in the draft text. However, what is most important is that the substance of the negotiating text will allow for meaningful management of aviation’s carbon footprint. Airlines support it and urge governments to agree when they meet at ICAO,"" said Alexandre de Juniac, IATA’s Director General and CEO.

IATA encourages governments to commit to their voluntary participation as soon as possible. ""Last year’s much lauded Paris climate change agreement was a combination of voluntary measures to which the vast majority of countries have already committed themselves. We expect no less of an outcome from the ICAO Assembly. The industry is ready. There is really no reason for governments not to volunteer. Indeed, the United States, China, Canada, Indonesia, Mexico, the Marshall Islands, and 44 European countries have already indicated their willingness to participate. Now is the time for other states to match their political leadership, by coming to the Assembly already committed to participate, even if the scheme is voluntary at the initial stage,"" said de Juniac.

""Airlines are committed to environmental responsibility. But achieving it requires a partnership with governments. That is clear in the development of a global market-based measure such as CORSIA. And it is the same for day-to-day operations. Airlines are investing heavily in new technology, the development of sustainable alternative fuels and operational efficiency. Our message to the states attending the ICAO Assembly is that they must match our efforts. This is particularly the case with investments to modernize air navigation infrastructure which will bring cost-efficiency benefits along with improved environmental performance. Similarly, government incentives to commercialize sustainable alternative fuels are critical to unlocking their environmental benefits with increased production capacity and lower costs,"" said de Juniac.

ICAO is the United Nations body charged with managing aviation’s climate change impact because of the complexity of emissions from any one flight which might occur over several countries and the high seas. As such, international aviation is not included in the agreement reached by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in December 2015.

ICAO was mandated by its 191 contracting states at its 38th Assembly (2013) to present a proposal for a global market based measure to manage aviation’s carbon footprint at its 39th Assembly. That proposal is the Carbon Offset and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA).

In June 2016, an overwhelming majority of IATA member airlines reiterated their desire to see a single, global and mandatory carbon offset scheme be implemented from 2020. This would fulfill one pillar of the industry’s four-pillar strategy on climate change which consists of:

 

 1. Improvements in technology and the deployment of sustainable alternative fuels

 2. Operational efficiency

 3. Infrastructure optimization

 4. A global market based measure",air-traffic
"The International Air Transport Association (IATA) released data for global air freight markets in July 2016 showing robust growth in demand. Measured in freight tonne kilometers (FTKs), demand increased 5.0% in July 2016, compared to July 2015. This was the fastest pace in almost 18 months. Freight capacity measured in available freight tonne kilometers (AFTKs) increased by 5.2% year-on-year, outstripping demand and keeping yields under pressure.

Despite the subdued global trade backdrop, carriers in the world's four biggest air cargo markets – Asia-Pacific, Europe, North America and the Middle East - reported an increase in freight demand. The strongest growth occurred in Europe and the Middle East, with July demand up by 7.2% and 6.7% respectively, compared to the same period last year.

""July was a positive month for air freight—which is an all too rare occurrence. Despite that, we must recognize that we face some strong headwinds on fundamental aspects of the business. Global trade growth is sluggish and business confidence is weak. And the political rhetoric on both sides of the Atlantic is not encouraging for further trade liberalization,"" said Alexandre de Juniac, IATA’s Director General and CEO.

¹% of industry FTKs in 2015   ²Year-on-year change in load factor   ³Load factor level

Asia-Pacific airlines reported a 4.9% increase in demand for air cargo in July compared to last year. In particular, growth has been driven by strong increases in the large ‘within Asia’ market in recent months, but the latest business surveys from the region paint a mixed picture. Capacity in the region expanded 2.7%.

North American carriers saw freight volumes expand 4.1% in July 2016 compared to the same period last year, and capacity increase by 3.4%. International freight volumes (which grew 1.3% in July) continue to suffer from the strength of the US dollar which has kept the US export market under pressure.

European airlines posted the largest increase in freight demand of all regions in July, 7.2% year-on-year. Capacity increased 3.8%. The positive European performance corresponds with an increase in export orders in Germany over the last few months. Europe’s freight volumes have now surpassed the level reached during the air freight rebound following the Global Financial Crisis. The only other region to achieve this is the Middle East.

Middle Eastern carriers saw air freight demand increase by 6.7% in July 2016 year-on-year. Capacity increased by 11%. The region’s growth rate, while still strong, has eased to half the 14% recorded annually between 2012 and 2015. This is mainly attributable to slower freight growth between the Middle East and Asia.

Latin American airlines saw demand contract by 5.6% in July 2016 compared to the same period last year and capacity increase by 10.1%. The region continues to be blighted by weak economic and political conditions, particularly in the region’s largest economy, Brazil.

African carriers recorded a 6.8% decrease in year-on-year freight demand in July 2016 – the largest decline in seven years. African airlines’ capacity surged by 31.3% on the back of long-haul expansion (from a small base).

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) announced global passenger traffic results for July showing an acceleration in demand growth over the previous five months. Total revenue passenger kilometers (RPKs) rose 5.9%, compared to the same month last year, with all regions reporting growth. Monthly capacity (available seat kilometers or ASKs) increased by 6.0%, and load factor was 83.7% - just 0.1 percentage point below the record July high achieved in 2015.

""July saw demand strengthen, after a softening in June. Demand was stimulated by lower fares which, in turn, were supported by lower oil prices. And near record high load factors demonstrate that people want to travel. But, there are some important sub-plots to the narrative of strong demand. Long-haul travel to Europe, for example, suffered in the aftermath of a spate of terrorist attacks. And the mature domestic markets are seeing demand growth stall while Brazil and Russia contract,"" said Alexandre de Juniac, IATA’s Director General and CEO.

 July international passenger demand rose 7.1% compared to July 2015, which was an increase over the 5.0% yearly increase in June. Airlines in all regions recorded growth. Total capacity climbed 7.3%, causing load factor to slip 0.2% percentage points to 83.5%.

Domestic Passenger Markets  

 Domestic travel demand climbed 3.8% in July compared to July 2015, its slowest pace in 19 months. China and India are booming while more mature markets are stuck in neutral, and Brazil and Russia are sliding backwards.

"EUROCONTROL and Comsoft Solutions are adding new functionality to ARTAS in order to increase system capacity and integrate advanced functions beneficial for current and future ATS demands.

Comsoft Solutions has been EUROCONTROL's Industrial Partner for ARTAS maintenance and support since 2001 and is also a turnkey supplier of ARTAS systems. ARTAS is an ATM Surveillance Tracker and Server which, over many years and continuous improvements, became the most deployed Tracker in Europe and one of the most advanced and mature surveillance data processing systems worldwide.

With the new developments, the nominal capacity of 48 sensors and 4096 system tracks can be increased (subject to validation) up to 255 sensors and 32000 system tracks. ARTAS can therefore cater for bigger airspace capacity and area-specific configuration parameters to enable its customisation for different areas of ARTAS’ domain of interest. A prototype, based on V8B4, will also integrate surface movement tracking functionality for ground control systems, an important step towards seamless gate to gate tracking.

Developed by EUROCONTROL on behalf of their Member states, ARTAS applies the latest multi sensor tracking technology to deliver an outstanding level of accuracy and reliability using PSR, SSR, Mode-S, ADS-B and Multilateration surveillance sources. The ability of ARTAS to act as an enabler for ADS-B and Multilateration makes it an important technology for the future of air traffic management.",air-traffic

As drones continue to take the world by a storm, key stakeholders are warning that the safety risks of drone operations may be seriously underestimated and deserve urgent attention. A Joint Statement, signed by the entire spectrum of manned aviation stakeholders – from pilots to airlines, helicopter operators to air traffic controllers – calls for “a robust harmonized EU-wide regulatory safety framework”. ECA, IATA, EHA, ACI EUROPE, ERAA, IACA, A4E, IFALPA, IFATCA and CANSO jointly ask for a number of measures to be taken, including mandatory drone registration, operator/drone pilot training & licensing, built-in performance limitations and robust oversight by the national aviation authority.

“Drones are such an appealing technology that many of the drone users are tempted to use them to the limits – or even beyond,” says Dirk Polloczek, President of the European Cockpit Association. “That means to the technical, legal and safety limits. We’ve seen, for example, an increase in hacks and modifications in order to extend the drone’s flight distance. We’ve also seen drones flying around airports and runways – which are strict “no-drone zones” – and this despite warnings that this is prohibited and dangerous. And we’ve seen a worrying increase in near-misses between manned and unmanned aircraft. Some drone operators are moving on a thin ice, and this could harm our entire industry and its safety record. So, Europe needs to act with a strong legal framework and effective enforcement.”

As Europe’s regulator is working on the rules right now, drone operations are already taking place, as do incidents and near misses between aircraft and drones. This is why the aviation stakeholders are calling for an extensive awareness raising campaign. “Some drone users don’t care about the legal and safety aspects of operating drones, while others are simply unaware of what might happen if they fly e.g. too high, or too close to an aircraft. This is why – as a first step – we need to make sure everyone – commercial or recreational drone operator – is aware what the safety risks are and how to avoid them,” says Johan Glantz, ECA Board Director.

› Compulsory registration of all drones at time of purchase or resale: This allows the owner/pilot to be traced, and will encourage compliance with rules & regulations.

› Mandatory training and a certificate/license for drone pilots, depending on the properties and performance of the drone and the nature of operations. This would enhance knowledge of the regulations and restrictions and help to develop necessary skills.

› Built-in Technical Performance Limitations such as geo-fencing and altitude / distance restrictions, to reduce the safety risks concerning critical airspace, terrain, and buildings.

› In-depth research into the impact of collisions between drones, incl. smaller ones, and manned aircraft.

› Integration of recreational drones into national Model Aircraft Flying Regulations, applying the same high safety standards for recreational users.

› Increase in the effectiveness of rule enforcement by national authorities, including training and technical equipment for their staff to be able to monitor and ensure compliance.",air-traffic
"Micro Nav Limited, the Bournemouth based provider of air traffic control and airport simulation systems, was today presented with the Queen’s Award for Enterprise in the category of Innovation. The award was presented by Her Majesty’s Lord-Lieutenant of Dorset, Mr Angus Campbell Esq. to Micro Nav’s Managing Director Stephen Williams at the company’s offices in Bournemouth.

  

 Her Majesty’s Lord-Lieutenant of Dorset, Mr Angus Campbell Esq., the Worshipful The Mayor & Mayoress of Bournemouth, Councillor & Mrs Edward J Coope and a host of local VIPs joined the company and group board for an afternoon of company presentations and product demonstrations, culminating in the presentation of the prestigious Queen’s Award.

  

 Demonstrations were made of some of Micro Nav’s products, including the BEST 3D air traffic control simulator, the Airside Driver Trainer, as well as the Automatic Display Alignment System (ADAS) for which Micro Nav has been awarded the Queen’s Award in the category of Innovation.

  

 ADAS is used in 3D air traffic control simulators and training systems. These simulators rely on the use of multiple projectors to present a simulated view that would be seen from a control tower at an airport. Historically, setting up and maintaining the calibration of multiple projector arrays has been achieved manually by skilled specialist engineers. ADAS uses high resolution digital cameras to automatically perform a geometric alignment of each of the projected images. This means that all of the projected images will align with the screen and each other. The system also automatically adjusts the colour and brightness so that all the images appear to be a single large image. Micro Nav has been granted a patent for this display systems innovation by the UK Intellectual Property Office.

  

 Managing Director, Stephen Williams said, “It is an honour for Micro Nav and our staff to be presented with the Queen’s Award today. It is a special occasion for everyone who works here and we can feel proud of our achievements. It is recognition of our high-calibre staff and the on-going investment that is made in our products to ensure that our customers are able to deliver high-quality training in the most efficient way.”

"The operational performance of the FABEC ANSPs clearly suffered from a number of negative circumstances in the first half of 2016. While an overall increase in traffic could be observed, traffic in Belgium underwent a drop after the terrorist attack at Brussels Airport. In addition, the number of flights to traditional European vacation spots in the eastern Mediterranean has also fallen off. In general, the traffic situation now continues to stabilise, but charter flights for holidaymakers have shifted from eastern to the western Mediterranean and the Canary Islands. So far, at the end of June 2016, FABEC air traffic controllers have guided a total of 2.75 million flights (+ 2.8 percent) safely through the airspace. During the same period, the number of take-offs and landings at the 83 FABEC airports rose to 1.23 million (+ 1.6 percent).

Air traffic punctuality continues along a favourable path. In the first half of 2016, 96.2 percent of all flights in the FABEC area experienced no delays caused by air traffic control (ATFM en-route delays). 98.2 percent arrived at their destination airports on time, i.e. within 15 minutes of the scheduled time. Nevertheless, the average delay due to en-route ATFM measures increased from 0.7 minutes to 1.2 minutes per flight. The primary cause of this evolution is weather related.

For the first time, weather – particularly the severe thunderstorms in the second quarter of 2016 – had an enormous impact on en-route air traffic. Every fifth minute of delay can be traced back to the fact that, in case of bad weather, air navigation service providers reduce capacity to ensure that passengers have a safe and smooth flight. Other factors resulting in a significant increase in delay were the implementation of a new ATC system at the control centre in Brest, social actions in France and staff shortages in Belgium and Germany. As in 2015, insufficient capacity was an issue in France and high and unplanned demand above forecast references has caused significant capacity delay in the Belgian airspace controlled by Maastricht UAC.

At the 83 monitored FABEC airports, punctuality remained excellent. Delay related to air traffic control was negligible. More than 56 percent of all delay minutes at airports was due to the weather.",air-traffic
"Airways New Zealand has reported a strong safety, operational and financial performance in the year ending 30 June, 2016.

CEO Ed Sims says, “Airways has maintained its strong safety record in the air traffic control industry, while reducing customer prices and delivering a record operating profit.”

The state-owned enterprise (SOE) achieved a Group Net Operating Profit after Tax (NOPAT) of $23.2 million, well ahead of a budgeted $16.5 million and 54 per cent up on the prior year.  Airways’ positive financial result was supported by an eight per cent increase in flight volumes from the prior year, in addition to strong cost management.

In May, Airways announced a 4.7 per cent price decrease for airlines over the next three year pricing period with general aviation prices maintained in line with inflation.

The SOE will also pay a $9m dividend to its shareholder, the New Zealand Government, an increase from $4m in the previous year.

Airways’ commercial businesses made strong gains, increasing NOPAT to $3.5m from $2.2m in FY15.

Over the year Airways increased its capital expenditure by 10 per cent, strengthening network efficiency and resilience and including significant new infrastructure at Queenstown Airport. This supports the region’s continued growth and provides greater convenience to the travelling public with evening flights now operating in the tourist town.

Airways Chair Susan Paterson says, “Airways New Zealand is a high performing SOE by all measures. It has delivered a price reduction to its airline customers, more than doubled its dividend to the Crown and achieved outstanding operational performance during a year of high air traffic growth and continued investment in New Zealand’s essential aviation infrastructure.”",air-traffic
"The Air Navigation Service Provider (ANSP) of Denmark, NAVIAIR, has contracted Comsoft Solutions to complete delivery of Quadrant ADS-B sensors to the country, in order to provide high accuracy Multilateration coverage for Denmark’s 61,000 square km of airspace and approaches.

The project, previously assigned to COMSOFT GmbH, included the country-wide placement of 26 WAM stations and 15 transmitters to be located at sites including Ålborg, Århus, Billund, Copenhagen and Roskilde airports, allowing advanced processing techniques to be performed.

Comsoft Solutions’ Quadrant sensors provide independent, genuine 3D, position measurement using Multilateration. Both the planned positions of sensors and the timing of information they collect will enable accurate positions to be determined for wide and local area systems, providing considerable range over secondary radar, with higher accuracy at significantly lower costs.

SureSelect is an industry leading, ATC-specific-recruitment and selection system designed by Airways International Ltd, a global ATC training provider and subsidiary of Airways New Zealand.

ATCs are a unique group – it is estimated that only 2-3% of the general population has the right combination of personality attributes and aptitudes to be successful in the job.

This year the FAA conducted a validation study using SureSelect which tested 2,000 candidates. The results of the study show that people who performed well on the SureSelect tests perform well on the job, Airways International Head of Training Sharon Cooke says.

“The research demonstrates that there is a close connection between on-the-job performance and the abilities we were testing for, which include short-term memory, visualisations skills and multitasking. SureSelect evolved out of the recruitment process used within New Zealand for many years and has been used successfully in a number of countries.

“Not only is there is a growing global shortage of ATCs, but the cost of training is significant and this ability to find the right people quickly and at much less cost gives the industry a big advantage,” Ms Cooke says.

Overall, the industry spends around US$480 million on ATC training every year. Around 30% of this cost, or US$143 million, is spent on trainees who fail to qualify and rate as ATCs.

SureSelect will be used by the FAA for at least the next five years.",air-traffic
"The Certification Management Team (CMT), comprised of leaders from four civil aviation authorities, has published a strategy  to develop and implement policies that streamline certification. The team includes the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Agencia Nacional de Aviaҫão Civil (ANAC) of Brazil, European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), and Transport Canada Civil Aviation (TCCA). The FAA and EASA also have established a bilateral Validation Improvement Roadmap (VIR) that defines the specific bilateral initiatives.

The continued globalization of the aviation industry has prompted collaboration among the world’s civil aviation authorities to harmonize regulatory systems. Industry growth has increased the level of domestic certification activity, and validation projects from emerging States of Design are placing growing resource demands on other authorities. By maximizing the use of existing U.S. bilateral partnerships with our CMT partner countries, we can reduce the amount of effort all of the agencies currently expend on validation programs.

Strong partnerships are a key to consistent safety standards around the world. As leaders in the global aviation community, the CMT members are pioneering a strategy that focuses on confidence-building initiatives and risk-based validation principles to accept partner certification activities with limited or no technical involvement. This is a significant expansion of previous initiatives, which allows the authorities to maximize their reliance on the certificating authority as much as possible.

The CMT Strategy and the FAA-EASA VIR support the FAA’s Global Leadership Initiative, which is transforming how the FAA prioritizes and targets resources to engage with the international aviation community to improve safety, efficiency, and environmental sustainability through regulatory harmonization and partnerships.",air-traffic
"Effective September 1, 2016, Johan Klintberg is appointed CEO of the company Saab Digital Air Traffic Solutions. At the same date, the company will commence its operations, to market, sell, develop and operate products and services for remote air traffic control.

On 29 June, defence and security company Saab and the Swedish Air Navigation Service Provider LFV signed an agreement to establish a new company: Saab Digital Air Traffic Solutions AB with Saab as the majority owner. The transaction was recently approved by the Swedish Competition Authority and the formation of the company can now be completed.

""Digital Air Traffic Control is in a very interesting phase with great global attention and I am convinced that Johan Klintberg, with his solid leadership experience and business acumen, will take our leading position on the market to the next level,” says Anders Carp, head of Saab’s business unit Traffic Management.

With digital and integrated traffic control, high technological systems will transfer information from sensors to the air traffic control centre, independent of geography. This will lead to increased flexibility, higher safety and more effective travelling for passengers. It will also reduce costs for air traffic control.

“The airport in Örnsköldsvik has been controlled from the LFV Remote Tower Centre in Sundsvall since April 2015 and within a year another two airports, Sundsvall Timrå Airport and Linköping City Airport, will be connected to RTC in Sundsvall. Johan Klintberg’s experience will in an excellent way drive the digital transformation and the demands of the market further, ""says LFVs Director General Olle Sundin.

Saab and LFV in partnership have initiated the world's first system for remote-controlled, digital air traffic control - Remote Tower. The system is a vital driving-force behind continued innovative, digital development within air traffic control.

"The International Air Transport Association (IATA) announced that Alexandre de Juniac has officially taken on the role of Director General and CEO of the organization. He succeeds Tony Tyler, who served as IATA DG and CEO since 2011 and had announced his retirement.

""I am excited to be taking on this great responsibility. IATA plays a critical role in facilitating safe, efficient and sustainable global air transport. Tony Tyler has raised the bar through his achievements over the last five years. With the guidance of our Board and the support of our membership, my aim is to ensure that IATA continues to deliver the value that our members and partners rely upon,"" said de Juniac.

De Juniac was confirmed by the 72nd IATA Annual General Meeting this past June to be the seventh person to lead IATA. He brings diverse experience to the association, including leadership roles in the airline and aerospace sectors as well as in government.

""IATA touches almost every aspect of the air transport industry and interacts with a wide range of stakeholders—especially governments. I will call on all my experience to ensure that IATA meets the needs of our members and plays a leading role in responding to the challenges that the industry faces. In particular, the accelerating pace of change in the world means that we must be able to move even more rapidly—as an industry and as an association. IATA’s mission is to represent, lead, and serve the airline industry with global standards. For me that means we must use change as a catalyst for innovation to please customers and contribute positively to the business of our members,"" said de Juniac.

De Juniac emphasized the need for industry stakeholders, especially governments, to recognize the value that aviation creates. ""The numbers are clear. Air transport supports an impressive 63 million jobs and some $2.7 trillion in economic activity. But that’s only a part of the value that aviation creates. Our industry is in the business of freedom. We help people to explore the planet, to do business globally, to bridge cultures with friendships and understanding, and to enjoy better lives through the prosperity that connectivity creates.

"The Warsaw University of Technology (WUT) and Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) successfully demonstrated their UAV optimization technologies using aerial command and control (C2) of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).

The demonstration marks another successful milestone in the joint WUT-Lockheed Martin advanced applied research program on optimization of diverse fleets of aircraft, and concepts associated with manned-unmanned command and control of airborne platform systems.

""These technologies have tremendous commercial and military potential as the world moves toward greater and greater use of unmanned aerial systems,"" said Prof. Janusz Narkiewicz, head of WUT's Department of Automation and Aeronautical Systems. ""Understanding how different assets can interoperate, communicate, and serve common objectives with maximum efficiency is a challenging task in the growing field of UAV technologies.""

Through the use of advanced mathematic calculations, and a systems-of-systems approach, the technology bolsters mission efficiency by adapting the fleet's commanded flight paths, speeds, division of duties, and sensor performance. Modeling all the constraints of the task at hand, the students calculate the ""best answer,"" usually beating either the human best guess or simpler approaches by 10 to 20 percent.

The goal of the team's latest project was to advance previous optimization work by incorporating airborne C2, improving user interfaces, and testing new methods for related subroutines. With a vision of ultimately developing fast dynamically adaptive approaches to live management of a UAV fleet, this work is an important contribution to the concept of manned-unmanned teaming, where manned assets operate seamlessly with surrogate UAVs, often controlling many at a time against specific tasks.  This technology demonstrates that, with the right tools, an operator may adapt to changing scenarios, calculate new solutions, and deploy those new, optimized solutions to the fleet of commanded aircraft, whether for civil or military purposes.

The recent demonstration can be equated to a search and rescue task, where every minute shaved off of a search pattern could be the difference between life and death. In another example, if UAVs were to be used to deliver small packages to consumers, the 10 to 20 percent performance improvement could be the competitive edge that keeps an operation in business ahead of the competition.

The program builds on the strong industrial and academic partnership between Poland and Lockheed Martin aimed at motivating young Polish engineers to address tomorrow's defense and industrial needs. WUT and Lockheed Martin are seeking new Polish partners to further advance Polish research and development capabilities on manned-unmanned airborne platform system integration.

ASSC processes Automatic Dependent Surveillance – Broadcast (ADS-B) data along with other sensor sources to provide a single, fused view of the airport runways and taxiways. In addition, the flexible nature of the ASSC system architecture enables future airport surface safety enhancements, such as Runway Status Lights (RWSL), which is currently being deployed at San Francisco International Airport, and airport surface movement data distribution to other approved systems and users.

Saab provides air traffic management solutions for civil aviation, airport and airline customers in more than 40 countries across six continents.",air-traffic
"The 26th of July 2016 marked the beginning of cooperation between ECCAS and the Joint Programme Office (EGNOS in AFRICA Support Programme -Joint Programme Office),  "" JPO "" , by signing the Memorandum of Cooperation; ECCAS represented by its Secretary General His Excellency Ambassador Ahmad Allam -Mi , and JPO represented by its Director , Mr Ladislaus Matindi.

The signed Memorandum of Cooperation will guide the collaboration between the two organizations in the field of satellite navigation, specifically on the potential implementation and operation of GNSS / EGNOS in ECCAS member States and its applications in all sectors ( aviation , maritime , rail, road , agriculture , land management, etc.).

The Joint Office EGNOS-Africa Programme (JPO) is indeed a Pan-African ""instrument"" for coordination and support to the implementation of GNSS / EGNOS and the provision of related services in Africa. As an outcome of the cooperation between Africa and the European Union, the JPO was established in December 2013 with an initial objective of capacity building for Africa within the framework of an intra-ACP programme ""Support to Aviation Sector and satellite services in Africa"". JPO has notably developed a roadmap for the implementation of EGNOS in Africa for the benefit of all stakeholders including the States. In 2016, the JPO enters a second operational phase under the 'Support EGNOS in Africa Programme' which is co-financed by the EU with a contribution of ASECNA.

Looking at the background, the conclusion of this agreement follows several meetings during the thematic workshops both on technical and institutional subjects, which were organized over Africa in 2014 and 2015 in the framework of SAFIR project as well as exchanges and consultations including a meeting that brought together in March 2015 a delegation of JPO experts and ECCAS under the supervision of Directory of DIPEM, a meeting which was concluded by the audience of the then Deputy Secretary General (SGA / DPBARH).

Thanks to this agreement, the preparatory activities relative to the preliminary decision making for the creation of a regional module (Western and Central Africa) which would be in charge of the implementation of SBAS / EGNOS services can be launched. The main objectives will be on capacity building in member countries through workshops, awareness activities on EGNOS system and its applications within States and collaboration in studies related to the SBAS / EGNOS programme.

As highlighted by the SGA during her audience to the JPO Delegation led by its Deputy Director, ""it is important to take into consideration the need for coordination between ECCAS, CEMAC, ECOWAS and UEMOA in the implementation of EGNOS."" This is even more true since the SBAS / EGNOS system has been primarily designed as a tool for regional integration.",air-traffic
"The Borealis Alliance has been awarded considerable financial support to continue its work to deliver Free Route Airspace across Northern Europe by 2021.

The funding of €63.2 million has been granted to support the ongoing evolution of the Borealis Free Route Airspace programme, extending the number of countries in which Free Route Airspace is available and joining those areas of Free Route Airspace together.

On July 8, the EU Member States formally approved the recipients of the EU financial support under the 2015's calls for proposals of the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) funding. The Borealis Free Route Airspace programme has been supported as part of SESAR–related activities contributing to a sustainable and efficient ATM network in Europe, in line with the European Commission’s Single European Sky (SES) initiative. It was one of 195 transport projects awarded funding.

"Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Administrator Michael Huerta today announced that the agency has selected the University of Oklahoma and Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University teams to lead the new Air Transportation Center of Excellence for Technical Training and Human Performance (COE TTHP). The COE will conduct research and development on technical training for air traffic controllers, aviation safety inspectors, engineers, pilots and technicians.

“This world-class, public-private partnership will help us focus on the challenges and opportunities of this cutting-edge field of research,” Administrator Huerta said. “We expect this team will help us educate and train aviation professionals well into the future.”

The academic team members all have nationally-recognized collegiate aviation-related education programs and core members also own and operate their own aircraft and airports. A partnership of principal investigators from the different universities will perform the research projects. The universities will engage senior faculty as well as graduate-level and undergraduate students in their research activities.

The FAA expects the COE will be fully operational and engaged in a robust research agenda within the next few months.

The FAA will take advantage of advancements in teaching, such as part-task training, modeling, immersive human-in-the-loop simulation, and adaptive learning technologies that are standard in other technical workforces. The COE will examine human factors issues such as changes in learner expectations and academic best practices for training a new generation of learners. The center also will research innovative training methods for this new generation. This includes new technologies such as mobile learning as well as new ways of collecting and managing training data.

The FAA’s Center of Excellence program is a long-term, cost-sharing partnership between academia, industry and government. Congress authorized Air Transportation Centers of Excellence under the Federal Aviation Administration Research, Engineering and Development Authorization Act of 1990. This legislation enables the FAA to work with center members and affiliates to conduct research in airspace and airport planning and design, environment and aviation safety, as well as to engage in other activities to assure a safe and efficient air transportation system.

The FAA has established 12 Centers of Excellence in critical topic areas focusing on: unmanned aircraft systems, alternative jet fuels and environment, general aviation safety, commercial space transportation, airliner cabin environment, aircraft noise and aviation emissions mitigation, advanced materials, general aviation research, airworthiness assurance, operations research, airport pavement and technology, and computational modeling of aircraft structures.

"The U.S. Department of Transportation’s Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) today announced that Indonesia complies with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) safety standards and has been granted a Category 1 rating.

The FAA first assessed Indonesia's civil aviation authority in September 1997 and found it in compliance with ICAO standards and then lowered the rating from Category 1 to Category 2 in April 2007. While under a Category 2 rating, the country either lacked laws or regulations necessary to oversee air carriers in accordance with minimum international standards, or its civil aviation authority – a body equivalent to the FAA for aviation safety matters – was deficient in one or more areas, such as technical expertise, trained personnel, record-keeping, or inspection procedures.

The Category 1 status announced today is based on a March 2016 FAA assessment of the safety oversight provided by Indonesia’s Directorate General of Civil Aviation. A Category 1 rating means the country’s civil aviation authority complies with ICAO standards.  With the International Aviation Safety Assessment (IASA) Category 1 rating, Indonesian air carriers that are able to secure the requisite FAA and DOT authority, can establish service to the United States and carry the code of U.S. carriers.

As part of the FAA’s IASA program, the agency assesses the civil aviation authorities of all countries with air carriers that have applied to fly to the United States, currently conduct operations to the United States, or participate in code sharing arrangements with U.S. partner airlines, and makes that information available to the public.  The assessments determine whether or not foreign civil aviation authorities are meeting ICAO safety standards, not FAA regulations.

In order to maintain a Category 1 rating, a country must adhere to the safety standards of ICAO, the United Nations’ technical agency for aviation that establishes international standards and recommended practices for aircraft operations and maintenance.  IASA information is posted at www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa/",air-traffic

"NextGen is bringing new benefits to Salt Lake City International Airport through a technology called Data Comm. Data Comm revolutionizes communications between air traffic controllers and pilots by replacing some traditional voice communications with digital information exchanges.

Voice communication is labor intensive, time consuming and can lead to miscommunications known as “talk back, read back” errors. Data Comm, by contrast, enables streamlined, two-way data exchanges between controllers and flight crews for clearances, instructions, advisories, flight crew requests and reports.

By exchanging digital messages, air traffic controllers, pilots and airline operations centers can communicate more clearly and efficiently. Better communication improves controller and pilot productivity, improves safety, can reduce flight delays and can help aircraft fly more direct routes, which saves time and fuel while reducing aviation’s impact on the environment. Several U.S. carriers are benefiting from Data Comm capabilities at Salt Lake City, including Southwest, FedEx, UPS, American, Delta and various general aviation operators.

The FAA began testing Data Comm capabilities and benefits in 2014 at Newark and Memphis with UPS, FedEx and United Airlines, as well as select international operators. The FAA started deploying Data Comm in air traffic control towers in the fall of 2015 and aims to have it in more than 50 towers by the end of 2016.  The technology will be installed in air traffic control facilities that manage high altitude traffic beginning in 2019.",air-traffic
"EIZO today announced the new Raptor SQ2825, a 28.1-inch primary control monitor with 2048 x 2048 native resolution for air traffic control (ATC) centers.

EIZO has been an industry leader in the innovation and development of 2K primary control LCD monitors for over 10 years. Backed by more than 45 years of expertise in visual display solutions, the Raptor SQ2825 is a 5th generation 2K x 2K monitor that adds further value with new technology and improved operational reliability.

The monitor features a new, sleek cabinet design with unobtrusive bezels that are 40% slimmer than the previous model, measuring just 36.1 mm so air traffic control officers (ATCO) can focus more on the screen. The monitor’s depth has also been reduced, bringing the weight distribution closer to the center of mass, resulting in less stress on mounting fixtures over time. Weighing just 14.6 kg, it is also 50% lighter and more compact than its predecessor.

The Raptor SQ2825’s newly designed rear housing can be easily configured to any mounting requirements without needing to remove any part of the housing. A chassis adapter or stand can be attached quickly, ensuring the flexibility to efficiently meet the requirements of any new installation or hardware refresh.

The monitor is equipped with a unique direct LED backlight system which features superior brightness uniformity for smoother images compared to edge-type backlight solutions. It also has 16% more LED cells than the previous model for increased efficiency. The backlight system is newly designed and is divided into four interchangeable quadrants, each of which performs consistently over a lifetime of 100,000 hours. Each quadrant is controlled by redundant sub-unit driver boards that protect the on-screen information from being visually impacted in the unlikely event that an LED stops performing. The Raptor SQ2825’s backlight system also allows it to achieve a wide brightness range of 2 to 500 cd/m2 to suit the workstation environment as well as the needs of the ATCO.

Consistent with each of EIZO’s 2K x 2K primary control monitors, the Raptor SQ2825 emphasizes durability and reliability over all else when it comes to long term use. It is developed specifically to meet the stringent requirements of mission-critical ATC with 24/7 operation. The monitor uses full sheet steel industrial-grade housing for durability in demanding environments. It is also designed to maintain low heat output, a leading cause of component failure, without a fan for reliability as well as noiseless operation.

Protection glass is available as an option with two variations – standard and fully flat. Standard glass covers the visible part of the LCD panel and extends to the inside of the bezel. Fully flat glass reaches to the edge of the monitor for a smooth, streamlined look. The monitor’s housing is also built with edge protection for fully flat glass so it is not exposed and vulnerable to damage.

EIZO offers extensive customization of its 2K x 2K primary control monitors so system integrators and ANSPs can build the monitor that best suits their needs. Customization includes, but is not limited to, mounting configuration, video signal interfaces, cabinet color, protection glass, and warranty upgrades.

"Defence and security company Saab’s new SR-3 surface movement radar system has been formally accepted by the Air Navigation Services of the Czech Republic (ANS CR) for full operational use at Václav Havel airport Prague.

Saab was awarded the contract to install a new Surface Movement Radar (SMR) system at Václav Havel airport Prague in March of this year. In less than five months, Saab has successfully completed the installation and optimization of the system and has now received final acceptance sign-off.

“The programme has been executed quickly and effectively. The SR-3 was built from the ground up with a focus on performance and simplified maintenance and installation. This was achieved through close co-operation with our partner, ANS CR,” said Anders Carp, head of Saab business unit Traffic Management within business area Surveillance.

The SR-3 radar delivers critical situational awareness and safety in all weather conditions. It will be used for the detection of non-cooperative targets -- including aircraft, ground vehicles, and other obstacles -- and integrated into the existing Advanced Surface Movement Guidance & Control Systems (A-SMGCS) system at the Prague airport. The SR-3 provides both a digital ASTERIX CAT240 and analogue video output, allowing it to serve as a drop-in replacement for aging radar installations. With the SR-3, customers can control costs and incrementally upgrade their existing systems.

Based on more than ten years of experience fielding solid state radars, the SR-3 employs an open architecture design that utilizes industry standard interfaces for easy integration into existing or new air traffic control systems.

"Indra has taken part in the exercises conducted within the framework of SESAR,  the technological cornerstone of the future Single European Sky, to validate a new concept of operations designed to enhance precision and predictability in flight management (Target Time Management) and improve the synchronisation of the Airport Operations Plan with the air traffic European Network Operations Plan (AOP-NOP).

As part of these exercises, Indra supplied its Airport Operations Plan (AOP), which guarantees a common operations plan in the airport for all the parties involved in its management. These include the airport operator itself, the various airlines, those responsible for handling services and the local air traffic manager, among others.

The integration of all this airport information with the European aeronautical network will ensure unprecedented precision in the management of air operations.

The exercise took place in May in the airports of Barcelona, Madrid, Alicante and Palma, with the participation of their respective air traffic flow control centers.

Each of these airports had an Indra AOP airport planning system connected to EUROCONTROL's Network Manager validation platform, on which this exercise was conducted.

This platform assessed ways to resolve in advance the air traffic bottlenecks that occur in airports (hotspots), by testing new procedures for traffic Demand Capacity Balancing (DCB). This succeeded in avoiding saturation in airports while optimizing the use of airspace.

One of the greatest benefits of this validation exercise was that the synchronization horizon between the Airport Operations Plan and the Network Operations Plan was constantly achieved 24 hours in advance. This made it possible to track air traffic patterns and their impact on the four airports and the rest of the European airspace through its network manager.

The successful integration of Indra's system with the Network Operations Plan (NOP) highlights the company's solution as one of the most advanced for enabling airports to join the Single European Sky and optimize their operations.

The validation trials carried out within the SESAR program were conducted by EUROCONTROL, as the Network Manager; AENA as an airport operator; ENAIRE, as a provider of air navigation services; and Indra, as a technology partner.

As the technological pillar of the Single European Sky initiative, SESAR aims to modernise and harmonise air traffic management in Europe. The SESAR Joint Undertaking (SESAR JU) was established in 2007 as a public-private partnership to support this endeavour.",air-traffic
"A new satellite-supported system designed to replace radar as New Zealand’s main aircraft tracking technology is a step closer. Airways New Zealand has secured a supplier of ground infrastructure for its Automatic Dependent Surveillance – Broadcast (ADS–B) network.

“The network will provide a more detailed picture of our airspace than is currently possible with radar. It will enhance the way aircraft are monitored in domestic airspace and will play a crucial role in supporting the growth of air travel in New Zealand,” Airways’ Chief Operating Officer Pauline Lamb says.

ADS-B uses satellite GPS systems, aircraft transmitters and a network of ground station receivers to follow aircraft with a more precise level of accuracy. With a network of ground receivers installed even in remote locations, the system will detect aircraft in places where there is limited radar coverage, like behind mountain ranges and at low altitudes in regions such as the Hawkes Bay, Gisborne and much of the South Island’s west coast.

ADS-B is the global standard for airspace surveillance and its introduction here is a key part of the New Southern Sky programme, the Government’s 10-year plan to modernise New Zealand’s aviation system.

An intense period of air traffic growth is forecast for the Asia Pacific region. Visitor numbers to New Zealand are set to hit 4.5 million annually by 2022 and with 99% of them arriving by air, ADS-B will help to provide the airspace capacity to handle increased numbers, Ms Lamb says.

“The precise tracking ability and increased surveillance coverage ADS-B provides allows us to reduce the separation between aircraft to have them safely fly closer together and on the most direct route, improving the flow of traffic and reducing environmental impacts,” Ms Lamb says.

“In an emergency or search and rescue situation, this level of detail would mean we would be able to provide help to an aircraft in distress much more quickly.”

Airways has awarded a contract to French multinational Thales to provide ground equipment for the $12 million network. Installation work will begin in early 2017 and the first phase of the network will be operational by the end of December 2018 when a Civil Aviation rule is planned to be implemented requiring all aircraft flying in controlled airspace above 24,500 feet in New Zealand to be using ADS-B. The requirement will be extended to all controlled airspace by the end of 2021 when the current radar system will be de-commissioned.

The relatively low cost of ADS-B ground equipment compared to traditional radar makes it the most cost-effective option for expanding New Zealand’s surveillance capability.

A smaller radar network will remain in place in New Zealand as a back-up.",air-traffic
"Negotiations to complete the first global agreement on capping a single sector’s climate impact are due to resume in Montreal on Tuesday as the world’s governments meet for the International Civil Aviation Organization’s (ICAO) 39th Assembly. The Assembly, which takes place every three years, will focus heavily on finding agreement between governments to develop a carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation, to be known as the CORSIA.

The Executive Director of the cross-industry Air Transport Action Group, Michael Gill, said that the time had come for governments to make an historic decision: “The aviation industry has been committed to developing a scheme such as the CORSIA for the last six years and has been working to convince governments of the important role of the scheme as part of a package of climate action for aviation. We are very close to that agreement becoming a reality. We urge governments meeting at ICAO agree on the world’s first sectoral market mechanism for tackling climate change.”

Following lengthy negotiations between governments meeting at ICAO, over the last six months the scheme has evolved to adopt a phased approach, where the first six years of CORSIA will be voluntary in nature. Whilst the industry remains in favour of a mandatory approach, it says that the initial voluntary system can work if enough States volunteer.

Gill comments: “We are heartened to see around 60 States now demonstrate their willingness to join the offset scheme voluntarily, from the beginning. We continue to encourage all other States meeting over the next two weeks of the ICAO Assembly to show the same leadership and to sign up to the CORSIA. Now is the time to follow the successful Paris Agreement with an aviation plan of action which will secure the sustainable future of the air transport sector.”

The cross-industry approach has been a strong catalyst for action at ICAO, with all parts of the commercial aviation industry supporting a pragmatic offsetting scheme as part of a wider set of actions, including new technology, improvements in operational efficiency and investment in modern infrastructure.

“Airports Council International (ACI) has continuously cooperated with the wider aviation community for the sustainable development of the sector,” said Angela Gittens, Director General, ACI World. “Airports have been actively contributing to the reduction of aviation emissions through the Airport Carbon Accreditation programme. The 25th ACI-NA/World Annual General Assembly is expected to approve on 28 September 2016, a Resolution reaffirming ACI’s support, alongside the rest of the industry, for CORSIA as the single global market-based measure for international aviation. ACI is also expecting this support from the ICAO Assembly.”

Civil Air Navigation Services Organisation (CANSO) Director General, Jeff Poole, said, “Air traffic management (ATM) is contributing significantly to the reduction of aviation emissions and thus reducing the need for carbon offsets. Welcome improvements are being achieved  through operational efficiencies such as: allowing aircraft to fly the most efficient and shortest flight path rather than fixed routes, and to fly at optimum altitude and speed over oceanic airspace; smoother arrival and departure flight profiles at airports; and reducing delays through collaborative decision making between ATM, airports and airlines.”

International Air Transport Association (IATA) Director General and CEO, Alexandre de Juniac said, “Airlines are committed to improving environmental performance with improved technology, operations and infrastructure. The industry fully supports and encourages the adoption of a carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation (CORSIA) by the states attending the ICAO Assembly. It is a critical tool for our carbon neutral growth commitment and positive momentum is building among governments. Already a significant number of states have raised their hands to be early voluntary adopters. Aviation is the business of freedom. Agreeing CORSIA will play a key role in safeguarding air transport’s role in economic and social development, and ensure that future generations have the freedom to explore our beautiful planet sustainably.”

International Business Aviation Council (IBAC) Director General, Kurt Edwards, said, ""Business aviation has renewed this year its 2009 Commitment on Climate Change. As part of a broader package of measures, including infrastructure modernisation, new technology, and operational improvements, a global carbon-offsetting scheme for international aviation will help the industry meet its goals. We join with our industry peers in encouraging States meeting at ICAO to agree on a global measure that is fair, proportionate, and administratively simple.""

Chair of ICCAIA, David Melcher, the President and CEO of the Aerospace Industries Association, said, “We are optimistic that a resolution on this critical agreement will be made at this year’s ICAO Assembly. In combination with other industry actions, including the continuous improvements in aircraft and engine efficiencies, operational improvements, and sustainable alternative fuels this historic plan is key to maintaining the sector’s trajectory of carbon neutral growth from 2020.”

As part of a campaign to encourage governments to support the scheme, ATAG has enlisted the voices of young aviation professionals from across the world in a series of video interviews. Michael Gill says: “the next generation of aviation leaders understand the important role early environmental action will play in securing the sector’s future. They look to the ICAO Assembly for leadership on this issue and so does the industry”. The videos can be seen at www.vimeo.com/AviationBenefits",air-traffic
"The Polish Air Navigation Services Agency and DroneRadar are developing a smartphone app for drone operators.

DroneRadar is an app designed to boost situational awareness of drone operators and make both manned nad unmanned flying in Polish airspace safer. The main idea is to safely integrate drone traffic into both controlled and uncontrolled airspace.

DroneRadar gathers information about the drone operators current location. After „Checking-in”, the data is sent in real time to PANSA’s Air Traffic Services. A simple three light „status indicator” (red, yellow and green dot) informs the drone operator if the location and time are OK to fly.

Also thanks to the app, FISOs and ATCOs  are aware of an unmanned flight taking place and can take action if nessesary. For example, the ATCO can contact the drone operator and grant him clearance into controlled airspace or urge him to cease his flight, due to an unexpected or emergency situation). DroneRadar also provides information to General Aviation pilots about drones flying nerby.

Operational testing is underway in Class G Airspace. Also controlled airports such as Gdańsk, Łódź, Poznań and Kraków already joined the tests.",air-traffic
"DFS and Austro Control implemented a new method to exchange flight data that increases the accuracy and timeliness of the data displayed on the radar screens in both the Karlsruhe and Vienna control centres. Data are no longer based on potentially outdated flight plan information. The new electronical data exchange, which is based on an OLDI specification (LATLON), will support the implementation of free route airspace.

Using the new method to coordinate data, both partners are now able to integrate the real-time planning horizons across ACC/UAC and FAB boundaries into their current operations. Previously, the trajectory data of each incoming flight had to be individually checked and manually updated as the data were mainly based on the flight plan. However, these data became less accurate as the flight progressed. Thanks to the new method, it is expected that numerous coordination activities per year will no longer be necessary. This reduces the workload of air traffic controllers, generates capacity and is a practical example of interoperability.

“This cooperation once again shows that substantial progress in the area of interoperability is possible – in a pragmatic way and across different systems,” says Robert Schickling, COO of DFS.

ATM systems have exchanged coordination data electronically for many years. In a conventional ATM environment, airspace design is based on a fixed route network and predefined coordination points (COP). In a free route environment, the number of route options is significantly higher, allowing customers to plan their flights using a variety of criteria (wind, fuel burn, etc.). By using the new method, the number and position of COPs between the sectors will no longer be relevant. The number of options will increase significantly.

To deal with this increase, a new method for the coordination of flight data regardless of COP (OLDI specification, LATLON format) has been implemented for the first time between DFS Karlsruhe UAC and Vienna ACC as of 9 June 2016. Further implementations allowing an exchange of updated trajectory information are scheduled for the upcoming months, aimed at the maximum use of this procedure with all neighbouring ACC/UAC and FABs.

Austro Control and DFS, as members of FABCE and FABEC respectively, are expecting significant benefits from this inter-FAB activity. Especially in view of the FABEC free route development and the SAXFRA (Slovenian/Austrian cross-border free route airspace) to be implemented in November 2016 under the FABCE umbrella. Each year, there are about 310,000 flights that cross the Austrian-German border, connecting two of the biggest functional airspace blocks.",air-traffic
"The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has awarded a contract to Lockheed Martin worth $344 million to develop and implement a new NextGen technology that will improve the efficiency of departures and arrivals, as well as the movement of aircraft on the ground. The new technology will save time for the flying public and lessen the impact on the environment by reducing emissions and noise.

Terminal Flight Data Manager (TFDM) will replace the paper flight strips that air traffic controllers currently use at most airports to share flight plans with electronic flight strips that will enable faster and more informed tactical decisions. The electronic strips will improve work efficiency, making it easier for controllers to accommodate traffic volume changes, bad weather and other evolving situations.

With TFDM, the digital flight plans used to estimate arrivals, gate push-backs, routings, departures and overall airport demand will be shared in real time among air traffic controllers, aircraft operators and airports to improve the handling of more than 40,000 flights each day. The shared awareness of aircraft on the ground and in the air will enable arrivals, departures and surface flow to be managed more efficiently, providing accurate, predictive modeling tools to improve flight efficiency from gate to gate.

Other benefits include improved aircraft traffic flow on the ground, which maximizes airport efficiency, reduced taxi-time delays, and enhanced safety through an increase in controllers’ heads-up time.",air-traffic
"The International Air Transport Association (IATA) released global air freight data showing that demand measured in freight tonne kilometers (FTKs) slowed in May with growth falling to 0.9% year-on-year. Yields remained pressured as freight capacity measured in available freight tonne kilometers (AFTKs) increased by 4.9% year-on-year.

Freight demand decreased or flat lined in May across all regions with the exception of Europe and the Middle East. These regions recorded growth in air cargo volumes of 4.5% and 3.2%, respectively, in May, compared to the same period last year.

Broad weakness in world trade volumes, which have largely tracked sideways since the end of 2014, accounts for about 80% of air freight’s sluggish performance.

""Global trade has basically moved sideways since the end of 2014 taking air cargo with it. Hopes for a stronger 2016 are fading as economic and political uncertainty increases. Air cargo is vital to the global economy. But the business environment is extremely difficult and there are few signs of any immediate relief,"" said Tony Tyler, IATA’s Director General and CEO.

¹% of industry FTKs in 2015   ²Year-on-year change in load factor   ³Load factor level

Asia-Pacific airlines reported a 0.7% decrease in demand for air cargo in May compared to last year. Capacity expanded 3.7%. Airlines in Asia-Pacific continue to face headwinds from weak trade in the region and globally.

North American carriers experienced a decline in demand in year-on-year performance of 0.2%. Freight volumes have suffered from the strength of the US dollar which has kept the US export market under pressure. This has contributed to the freight demand of US carriers remaining in negative territory for the past twelve consecutive months.

European airlines witnessed a 4.5% increase in freight volumes and a 5.7% increase in capacity in May 2016. The positive European performance corresponds with an increase in export orders in Germany over the last few months.

Middle Eastern carriers saw demand expand by 3.2% and capacity rise 9.5% in May 2016 compared to the same period last year. Despite carriers in the region reporting the fastest growth in aggregate, demand conditions have weakened considerably. Annual growth in May 2016 was one-fifth of the pace registered in May 2015. This reflects both an easing in network expansion by the region’s main carriers over the past six months and weak trading conditions.

Latin American airlines reported a decline in demand of 9.7% and a decrease in capacity of 7%, as economic conditions continued to worsen in Latin America, particularly in the region’s largest economy, Brazil.

African carriers saw freight growth in May 2016 of 0.3% compared to the same period last year. African airlines’ capacity increased by 22.2% year-on-year on the back of long-haul expansion continuing the trend seen since December 2015.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) announced global passenger traffic results for May showing that demand (measured in revenue passenger kilometers, or RPKs) rose 4.6%, compared to the same month in 2015, which was the same level achieved in April. Capacity climbed 5.5%, which pushed the average load factor down 0.7 percentage points to 78.7%. Demand for domestic traffic rose 5.1%, outpacing international demand growth of 4.3%.

""After a very strong start to the year, demand growth is slipping back toward more historic levels. A combination of factors are likely behind this more moderated pace of demand growth. These include continuing terrorist activity and the fragile state of the global economy. Neither bode well for travel demand. And the shocks of Istanbul and the economic fallout of the Brexit vote make it difficult to see an early uptick,"" said Tony Tyler, IATA’s Director General and CEO.

¹% of industry RPKs in 2015   ²Year-on-year change in load factor   ³Load factor level

Annual growth in international RPKs slowed for the third consecutive month, to 4.3%, from 5% recorded in April year-over-year. Airlines in all regions recorded growth. Total capacity climbed 6.1%, causing load factor to slip 1.3 percentage points to 77.1%.

Domestic Passenger Markets 

 Domestic demand rose 5.1% in May compared to May 2015, which was up from the 4% year-on-year growth recorded in April. Results were decidedly mixed, with Brazil, Russia and Japan all showing declines. Domestic capacity climbed 4.4%, and load factor rose 0.5 percentage points to 81.7%.

¹% of industry RPKs in 2015   ²Year-on-year change in load factor 3 Load factor level  *Note: the seven domestic passenger markets for which broken-down data are available account for 30% of global total RPKs and approximately 82% of total domestic RPKs

The Bottom line 

 ""The shockwaves of the Brexit vote have extended worldwide and the fallout will affect the air transport industry, from both economic and regulatory perspectives. Aviation plays a vital role in supporting economic growth and development. As the post-Brexit regulatory framework is negotiated between the EU and the UK it is critical that there are no steps backward for aviation connectivity,"" said Tyler.",air-traffic

"ALTYS Technologies has unveiled SAGA to the international airport and ATC community during Airport Show in Dubai last May. SAGA is a turnkey solution for collaborative airport surface management that provides ATC and airport operators real-time visibility over airport surface and terminal area movements, as well as advanced statistics, reports, and alarms.

SAGA can be used either with an existing surveillance infrastructure or with ALTYS’s ASTRA ADS-B ground station and MLAT system.

SAGA provides a means to ensure safer airport operations through enhanced situational awareness – as well as heightened efficiency through better information-sharing among airport stakeholders. ALTYS developed SAGA in response to airports’ growing need to accommodate increased traffic flows despite infrastructure constraints.

Designed for use both by airside teams and strategic management, SAGA heightens users’ awareness over surface operations and provides quantitative performance indicators. SAGA allows users on airside operations teams to visually track aircraft – whether on the airport surface or in terminal area – as well as airside vehicles. The system’s interactive and collaborative web application allows a wide range of airport stakeholders to synchronously receive real-time updates and alarms, such as runway incursion, temporary exclusion zone incursion, and conflict risk alarms.

In addition to its real-time features for airside teams, SAGA boasts sophisticated analytics-generation capabilities in support to strategic management. The system provides operational monitoring and custom reports for in/off-block times, landing/take-off times, taxi in/out times, runway occupancy times, and airport segment utilization statistics – among others. SAGA’s KPIs help airport stakeholders come to informed decisions regarding challenging long-term operational situations, such as standard taxi route modifications and airport improvement projects. It also provides airport operators with an independent and reliable source of information to automatically generate timely and accurate airline invoices.

SAGA incorporates a Data Fusion system to integrate surveillance data flows (ASTERIX format) from multiple airport surveillance sources: SMR, ADS-B, and MLAT. It additionally processes data from other systems such as ACARS and ATC data link communications. It is flexible to integrate with existing surveillance infrastructures, or ALTYS’s ADS-B ground stations and multilateration system.

“We have worked closely with airport operators throughout the design and development process to best meet the end user’s needs and make SAGA as easy-to-use as possible,” says Patrick Rahmoune, Head of Monitoring and Data Engineering at ALTYS. “SAGA can be smoothly deployed at any airport Operational Control Center or Controller Working Position, and offers 24/7 web access over a secure server application. It is currently undergoing operational trials at a number of international and regional airports.”",air-traffic
"The SESAR Joint Undertaking has launched a call for exploratory research projects on the integration of drones into civil airspace within the framework of the SESAR 2020 research and innovation programme. Specifically, the call aims to stimulate initial solutions for drone traffic management, supporting the sharing of airspace between manned and unmanned systems. A total of EUR 9 million is earmarked for the research from the EU’s Horizon 2020 budget.

The growing drone market shows significant potential for Europe. However, the development of the drone industry is dependent on the ability of drones to operate in all areas of airspace, including at very low levels. Stimulating research and innovation in this domain and in relation to the traffic management of drone operations is therefore a ""must-have"" to safely unlock this growth.

The projects to be funded under this call are expected to address the key research questions impacting the operation of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) and remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) in the very low level (VLL), including beyond visual line of sight (B-VLOS) operations, as well as visual flight rules (VFR) environments.

The technical specifications of this call for proposals were established in close collaboration with the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). The Agency will consider, where appropriate, the results of the awarded project for its future activities in that domain.",air-traffic
"Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) has been awarded a $344-million contract by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to develop and deploy the Terminal Flight Data Manager (TFDM) system. This key NextGen system will provide electronic flight strips as well as improved surface management tools that will allow streamlined operations in the air traffic control towers for busy airports. The TFDM contract period of performance has a five-year base with seven one-year options.

Lockheed Martin along with principal subcontractor Saab Sensis will be using proven technology to develop the system. TFDM will work by integrating digital flight plans with surface surveillance data to create accurate, real-time predictive tools for the terminal environment. TFDM will share data among controllers, aircraft operators and airports so they can better stage arrivals and departures, and manage traffic flow within terminal airspace for greater efficiency. Additionally, the surface departure management will improve gate departure efficiency for the airlines and will significantly reduce or eliminate queues of airplanes waiting for departure on a runway.

""More than 23,000 flights take place every day, making it crucial for airports to leverage the most innovative systems and technology to keep airport traffic consistently flowing,"" said Paul Engola, vice president of Transportation and Financial Solutions for Lockheed Martin Information Systems & Global Solutions (IS&GS). ""The benefits of the Terminal Flight Data Manager tools are far-reaching, not only improving the passenger experience with fewer delays and missed connections, but also lowering greenhouse gas emissions through reduced airplane taxi times.""

Lockheed Martin IS&GS currently provides air traffic controller automation to the Air Route Traffic Control Centers for high altitude and oceanic air traffic control. Lockheed Martin IS&GS also provides the automation for Time Based Flow Management, a key decision support tool.

"Jeppesen, a Boeing Company, has agreed to issue the Universidad Carlos III in Madrid an educational license to use its Total Airspace and Airport Modeler (TAAM) software to enhance graduate-level research related to the study of air traffic management within its Department of Bioengineering and Aerospace Engineering.

Starting this fall, the university will incorporate instruction on general TAAM simulation concepts and practices into its regular aerospace engineering curriculum. It will provide 10 user licenses within its simulation lab environment to assist aerospace engineering students with related master’s thesis development. Universidad Carlos III is the latest in a growing number of universities that have integrated discounted academic Jeppesen TAAM licenses as an option for students within its educational resources and curriculum.

“The addition of TAAM software from Jeppesen provides our graduate-level students with state of the art simulation technology that is used in real world design applications,” said Manuel Soler, Aerospace Engineering assistant professor, Universidad Carlos III. “Being able to gain hands-on experience with this technology from the aviation sector offers our students the opportunity to gain practical knowledge in a dynamic airspace and airport simulation and modelling environment.”

Jeppesen TAAM technology provides a platform to create and analyze multiple factors in a simulated air traffic management environment to ultimately design more efficient airport and airspace operations. The technology is typically used in the aviation field by civil aviation agencies, air navigation service providers, airlines and airports to make more informed decisions.

“We welcome Universidad Carlos III Madrid into the TAAM user family and are glad to provide the technology to support and educate the next generation of fast-time simulation users, said Charles Steigerwald, director, Jeppesen Airspace Solutions. “Usage at the university level puts TAAM at the forefront of aviation research and serves to educate both students and Jeppesen on the simulation of new and innovative strategies within the air traffic management domain.”",air-traffic

 Dr. Ned Reese, WCG Vice President – Technical Training says the organisation is excited to be partnering with Airways to deliver ATC training services globally into the future.

“One area where we see significant potential for the US market is Airways’ Airbooks,” Dr. Reese says.

 

 Airbooks offers digitised content including videos, images, audio and games for a range of applications including ATC refresher training, reference manuals, ab initio (new) air traffic controller training, and engineering and business information.

 

 ”We think Airbooks has the potential to enable faster and more flexible training. Students access the resources online, check their knowledge as they go and employers get useful metrics on any areas of difficulty,” Dr. Reese says.

 

 Ms Cooke will be speaking about ATC training in the current environment at the Air Traffic Control Association (ATCA) annual conference in October. Airways and WCG will be sharing an exhibit showcasing Airbooks at the event.

"Thales announces that Air Navigation Services Aruba (ANSA), the air navigation service provider responsible for monitoring and securing the skies over Aruba, an island in Dutch Caribbean, has selected Thales TopSky-AMHS & Thales TopSky-AIS, as well as the implementation of Wide Area Multilateration (MLAT/ADS-B).

The first project includes equipment and training for a complete Aeronautical Message Handling System (AMHS) and Aeronautical Information Services (AIS) which includes flight preparation services and capacity for NOTAM office and Meteo preparation services.

Thales has also been chosen by ANSA to implement Wide Area Multilateration (MLAT/ADS-B) for cooperative surveillance within Aruba’s airspace and increased Air Traffic Management capabilities. This second project will enable ANSA to process surveillance data from sensors and display them on the existing TopSky-ATC system supplied by Thales at the Reina Beatrix International Airport, Aruba.

These projects confirm the long standing partnership with ANSA, which started in 1989 when Thales supplied VOR/ILS/DME. These equipment were modernized in 2004 and in 2011 Aruba renewed its confidence in Thales to supply its TopSky Air Traffic Control Center.

“Thales has always been and is a reliable partner and their commitment to quality is extraordinary. The implementation of the TopSky-AMHS, TopSky-AIS and MLAT/ADS-B projects will help propel Aruba to the next level of safety and efficiency in the benefit of all our airspace users” declared Mr Nilknarf E.I. Kock, CEO of ANSA.

This contract also underlines Thales’s increasing presence in Latin America for ATM solutions following the recent success with Jamaica & COCESNA in 2015 and deployment in Mexico, Dominican Republic and Panama over the last years.

"The revolutionary NextGen technology called Data Communications (Data Comm) is now operational at Washington Dulles International Airport.

“There is tremendous benefit in this change in the way pilots and air traffic controllers communicate,” said Jim Eck, Assistant Administrator for NextGen. “Data Comm will allow passengers to get off the tarmac, into the air and to their destinations more quickly. Airlines will be able to stay on schedule and packages will be delivered on time.”

The media saw Data Comm in action today during a tour of the Dulles air traffic control tower, a UPS Boeing 767 and a United Airlines Boeing 777. The FAA demonstrated how the NextGen technology enhances safety and reduces delays by providing text-based messaging capabilities between air traffic controllers and pilots.

Representatives from the FAA, UPS, United Airlines, the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association and the Professional Aviation Safety Specialists were on hand to give their perspective on a technology that is revolutionizing critical communications, beginning with departure clearance services at 56 airports before expanding to enroute airspace.

Leveraging equipment already installed on many aircraft, air traffic controllers and pilots are sending and receiving important flight information using digital text-based messages. At towers with Data Comm such as Dulles, controllers enter flight departure clearance instructions into a computer and push a button to electronically send the information to an aircraft’s flight deck. Flight crews view the information, press a button to confirm receipt, and press another button to enter the instructions into the aircraft’s flight management system.

Time savings is another major benefit. For instance, when pilots read back a series of complicated waypoints in a clearance with even one mistake – called a “readback/hearback” error – they must repeat the instructions until they are correct. A departure clearance using voice communications can take two to three times longer than one via Data Comm – and even longer as traffic increases. With Data Comm, transmissions are quickly sent and received electronically to help avoid delays. This benefit becomes even more pronounced during bad weather, when Data Comm enables equipped aircraft to take off before an approaching thunderstorm closes the departure window while aircraft relying solely on voice communications remain stuck on the ground waiting for the storm to pass.

Data Comm is expected to save operators more than $10 billion over the 30-year life cycle of the program and the FAA about $1 billion in future operating costs.

The first Data Comm-equipped airports – Salt Lake City and Houston’s George Bush Intercontinental and William P. Hobby – received tower departure clearance services eight months ahead of schedule in August 2015. The FAA and its industry partners are on target to deliver Data Comm to 56 airport towers by the end of the year.

"The Department of Transportation’s Federal Aviation Administration has finalized the first operational rules for routine commercial use of small unmanned aircraft systems (UAS or “drones”), opening pathways towards fully integrating UAS into the nation’s airspace. These new regulations work to harness new innovations safely, to spur job growth, advance critical scientific research and save lives.

“We are part of a new era in aviation, and the potential for unmanned aircraft will make it safer and easier to do certain jobs, gather information, and deploy disaster relief,” said U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx. “We look forward to working with the aviation community to support innovation, while maintaining our standards as the safest and most complex airspace in the world.”

According to industry estimates, the rule could generate more than $82 billion for the U.S. economy and create more than 100,000 new jobs over the next 10 years.

The new rule, which takes effect in late August, offers safety regulations for unmanned aircraft drones weighing less than 55 pounds that are conducting non-hobbyist operations.

The rule’s provisions are designed to minimize risks to other aircraft and people and property on the ground. The regulations require pilots to keep an unmanned aircraft within visual line of sight. Operations are allowed during daylight and during twilight if the drone has anti-collision lights. The new regulations also address height and speed restrictions and other operational limits, such as prohibiting flights over unprotected people on the ground who aren’t directly participating in the UAS operation.

The FAA is offering a process to waive some restrictions if an operator proves the proposed flight will be conducted safely under a waiver. The FAA will make an online portal available to apply for these waivers in the months ahead.

“With this new rule, we are taking a careful and deliberate approach that balances the need to deploy this new technology with the FAA’s mission to protect public safety,” said FAA Administrator Michael Huerta. “But this is just our first step. We’re already working on additional rules that will expand the range of operations.”

Under the final rule, the person actually flying a drone must be at least 16 years old and have a remote pilot certificate with a small UAS rating, or be directly supervised by someone with such a certificate. To qualify for a remote pilot certificate, an individual must either pass an initial aeronautical knowledge test at an FAA-approved knowledge testing center or have an existing non-student Part 61 pilot certificate. If qualifying under the latter provision, a pilot must have completed a flight review in the previous 24 months and must take a UAS online training course provided by the FAA. The TSA will conduct a security background check of all remote pilot applications prior to issuance of a certificate.

Operators are responsible for ensuring a drone is safe before flying, but the FAA is not requiring small UAS to comply with current agency airworthiness standards or aircraft certification. Instead, the remote pilot will simply have to perform a preflight visual and operational check of the small UAS to ensure that safety-pertinent systems are functioning property.  This includes checking the communications link between the control station and the UAS.

Although the new rule does not specifically deal with privacy issues in the use of drones, and the FAA does not regulate how UAS gather data on people or property, the FAA is acting to address privacy considerations in this area. The FAA strongly encourages all UAS pilots to check local and state laws before gathering information through remote sensing technology or photography.

As part of a privacy education campaign, the agency will provide all drone users with recommended privacy guidelines as part of the UAS registration process and through the FAA’s B4UFly mobile app. The FAA also will educate all commercial drone pilots on privacy during their pilot certification process; and will issue new guidance to local and state governments on drone privacy issues. The FAA’s effort builds on the privacy “best practices” the National Telecommunications and Information Administration published last month as the result of a year-long outreach initiative with privacy advocates and industry. (https://www.ntia.doc.gov/files/ntia/publications/voluntary_best_practices_for_uas_privacy_transparency_and_accountability_0.pdf)

Part 107 will not apply to model aircraft.  Model aircraft operators must continue to satisfy all the criteria specified in Section 336 of Public Law 112-95 (which will now be codified in part 101), including the stipulation they be operated only for hobby or recreational purposes.",air-traffic

"LFV and Saab have signed an agreement to upgrade the software at LFV Remote Tower Centre (RTC) in Sundsvall, introducing new functions that will support the simultaneous management of two airports (multiple operations).

The Remote Tower Centre is the control centre from which LFV has been operating remote air navigation services for Örnsköldsvik Airport since April 2015.

Work to develop, validate and analyse ways in which an air traffic controller might manage more than one airport from an RTC has been under way for many years, partly in the context of SESAR, the EU development programme for air traffic management, and also as part of other development projects.



The product to be supplied to LFV is based on a further development of Saab's product for multiple airport operations designed for the Irish Aviation Authority.



""This investment is part of LFV's plans to ensure that our Remote Tower Service (RTS) product is competitive in the long term and flexible enough to meet the needs of our airport customers,"" says Niclas Gustavsson, LFV's Director of Business Development and International Affairs. ""This is also the start of our work to get operational approval from the Swedish Transport Agency for multiple airport operations at the LFV RTC in Sundsvall"".

"The EUROCONTROL Performance Review Commission (PRC) has published its fourteenth ATM Cost-Effectiveness (ACE) Benchmarking Report. The ACE Report analyses the cost-effectiveness and productivity of 37 European Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs) in 2014, the latest year for which actual financial data are available, based on information submitted in July 2015. The report also examines changes in their cost-effectiveness over 2009-2014, with a strong focus on underlying performance drivers such as Air Traffic Controllers’ productivity, employment costs and support costs. In addition it provides an outlook of the performance planned over the five-year cycle covering 2015-2019.



This year, the report presents a ten-year analysis of the changes in ANSPs’ cost-effectiveness and its main economic drivers over 2004-2014. This covers the period before and after the economic recession (2004-2008); it aims at providing an understanding of how the pan-European ANS system reacted to the global recession which affected the aviation community in 2009. Over this ten-years period, ATM/CNS provision costs rose by +0.4% p.a. which was significantly less than the +1.4% p.a. increase in traffic (measured in composite flight-hours). As a result, unit ATM/CNS provision costs decreased by -1.0% p.a. (real terms) between 2004 and 2014.



“ANSP management, ATM policy makers, regulators and NSAs should pay particular attention to the findings of the ACE report in order to identify potential areas for improvement, and also to understand how cost-effectiveness performance evolved over time,” says Ralph Riedle, the PRC Chairman.



At system level, the analysis shows that ATM/CNS provision costs remained fairly constant in 2014, while traffic increased by +2%, resulting in a decrease in unit ATM/CNS provision costs (-2%) compared to 2013. As a result, 2014 records the lowest unit costs level achieved since the start of the ACE benchmarking analysis in 2001, the year when the Permanent Commission of EUROCONTROL adopted specific economic information disclosure requirements for monopoly ANSPs. However, in 2014, ATFM delays increased somewhat, denting the overall economic cost-effectiveness result.



Ralph Riedle further recognises that “looking ahead, with traffic set to grow even if in a moderate way, it is key that ANSPs continue to manage their costs, while also providing sufficient ATC capacity to achieve a balanced result for their customers.”",air-traffic
"As of June 23 airspace users see a seamless Free Route Airspace across NEFAB East (Estonia, Finland, and Latvia) and DK/SE FAB (Denmark and Sweden), enabling to plan and fly user preferred trajectories across these five states without boundaries.

This development builds on the earlier implementation of Free Route Airspace in DK/SE FAB and NEFAB and is the next step in optimizing flight operations in a large volume of airspace, expected to provide operational, environmental and cost benefits for airspace users. The FRA concept will also increase the compatibility between the flight plan and the trajectory flown, hence increasing the predictability for a given flight.

In the next steps, the seamless Free Route Airspace area will expand with erasing remaining borders with Norway and will continue further on with connecting to the Free Route Airspace in the UK, Ireland, and Iceland within the Borealis FRA programme. The concept removing boundaries between FRA in a large area in Northern Europe by 2021 will demonstrate how impressive the effects of free route operations are.

Cross-border Free Route operations are a significant initiative in delivering the European Commission’s vision of a Single European Sky, catering for less fragmented and more efficient ATM in Europe.

"In 2015, the service quality in terms of safety, capacity/punctuality and flight efficiency provided by the seven FABEC air navigation service providers ANA (Luxembourg), Belgocontrol (Belgium), DFS (Germany), DSNA (France), LVNL (Netherlands), MUAC (EUROCONTROL), and skyguide (Switzerland) remained at a high level as a result of the sustainable improvements made since the beginning of economic regulation in 2012. Despite this overarching positive trend, the capacity target and the horizontal flight efficiency target were not reached. The capacity target is measured by ATFM en-route delay, i.e. lack of punctuality due to air navigation services (ANS). The horizontal flight efficiency target reflects the deviation from the great-circle distance, i.e. the route which could be flown, disregarding airspaces reserved for military training, bad weather etc.

Last year, the air traffic volume in FABEC airspace increased by 1.8 percent from 5.51 million flights in 2014 to 5.61 million flights in 2015. Landings in the FABEC area grew by 1.1 percent in 2015 (2,513 million) compared with 2014 (2,485 million). The growth trend continued for the second consecutive year. Almost all FABEC control centres recorded a traffic increase in 2015. Nevertheless, there are still some significant variations between control centres and individual sectors. Moreover, when the long-term trend is considered, traffic volume was still below the values seen in 2007.

In 2015, there were once again no accidents caused by air navigation services in FABEC airspace. The level of safety was consistently high as proven by data on separation minima infringements and runway incursions. The number of separation minima infringements declined slightly (2011:1,301; 2015: 1,192), whereas the number of reported runway incursions increased over the last four years (2011: 473; 2015: 522). This could be related to a new reporting mechanism. The result was accompanied by sustainable improvements both in the effectiveness of the safety management and in Just Culture.

In 2015, 96.2 percent of all en-route flights in FABEC were on time, meaning that they experienced no delay caused by air traffic flow management (ATFM) measures. This is an excellent level of service quality and a slight improvement of 0.3 percentage points compared with 2011, when 95.9 percent were on time. While the average en-route delay was 0.74 minutes (44.4 seconds) per flight in 2011, it decreased to 0.70 minutes (42 seconds) in 2015. However, the ambitious target of 0.48 minutes of average ATFM en-route delay per flight set out in the FABEC Performance Plan was not met. The reasons for this development were local issues, such as structural capacity shortages in Maastricht – mainly due to unpredicted shifts in traffic flows – and Reims, a technical outage in Brussels and the introduction of new technical systems in Brest. Besides this, weather has an increasing impact on punctuality.

In 2015, the environmental performance of the FABEC ANSPs, measured in terms of horizontal flight efficiency, improved slightly compared to 2011. Based on correlated position reports for 2015, the average extra en-route distance per flight in FABEC airspace was 16.40 km compared with the great-circle distance. Thanks to the flexibility of our air traffic controllers, who provided short-cuts on a tactical level, the original planned flight distance declined by 14.51 km per flight. This represents 47 kg less fuel and 157 kg less CO2 emissions per flight. Compared with 2011, FABEC ANSPs were able to reduce the extra miles flown per flight by 8.3 percent (2011: 17.88 km).

""Once again, innocent travelers have been attacked in a cowardly and murderous act. Our thoughts are with the victims, and their families and friends,"" said Tony Tyler, IATA’s Director General and CEO.

""Air transport brings people together and facilitates both social and economic development. Istanbul has a particularly significant and historical role in connecting East and West.

"PRR 2015 has just been published by the independent Performance Review Commission (PRC) of EUROCONTROL. It gives an assessment of European Air Traffic Management (ATM) performance in 2015 across the key performance areas of Safety, Capacity, Environment, and Cost-efficiency.

Safety is the primary objective of Air Navigation Services (ANS). Overall, ANS Safety continues to be high in Europe with one accident with ANS contribution in 2015. However, there is scope for further improvement in order to maintain or even further improve safety levels in Europe.

Controlled flights in Europe increased for the second year in a row in 2015. However, the +1.5% growth in traffic in 2015 was not homogenous throughout the network and traffic flows were affected by the continuing Ukraine crisis and industrial action by air traffic controllers.

En-route Air Traffic Flow Management (ATFM) delays in the EUROCONTROL area increased for the second year in a row to reach 0.73 minutes per flight in 2015. “The performance deterioration was mainly attributed to ATC capacity issues and confirms the PRC concerns that ATFM delays could increase when traffic grows again if insufficient focus is being put on capacity planning and deployment” warns Ralph Riedle, PRC Chairman.

Despite further progress in the implementation of free route airspace in 2015, horizontal en-route flight efficiency deteriorated in 2015 after the continuous improvement over the past years.

European ANS cost-efficiency performance improved for the second year in a row in 2014, the latest year for which actual costs data is available. Compared to 2013, real en-route costs per service unit decreased by -5.0% and terminal unit costs decreased by -2.3%.

Click on the image below to download the report.

PRR 2015 presents an assessment of the performance of European Air Navigation Services (ANS) for the calendar year 2015. Note that the Cost-efficiency data presented in Chapter 6 relate to the calendar year 2014, which is the latest year for which actual financial data are available.

Controlled flights in Europe increased for the second year in a row in 2015 (+1.5% vs 2014). The observed growth is in line with the STATFOR (Feb. 2015) baseline forecast scenario (+1.5%) predicted for the area. Total flight distance (+1.8% vs.2014) and flight hours (+1.7% vs.2014) increased at a slightly higher rate due to, on average, longer flights. 



 



According to the latest STATFOR 7-year forecast (Feb. 2016), flights are expected to grow by 2.4% in 2016 (Low: 1.0%; High 3.8%) and to continue with an average annual growth rate of 2.2% between 2015 and 2022 (Low: 0.7%; High 3.8%). Air traffic in Europe is expected to reach pre-economic crisis levels (2008) by 2017. 



In absolute terms, Turkey, Bulgaria, Hungary, the UK, and Spain (Continental) experienced the highest year-onyear growth in 2015 and all of the six largest States in terms of traffic volume (Germany, France, UK, Italy, Spain, and Turkey) showed an increase in traffic in 2015. Turkey continued its remarkable traffic growth (average annual growth rate of 7% over the past 5 years) and shows a substantial growth in all segments (domestic, international, overflights). 



The growth observed in a number of central European States (Bulgaria, Hungary, Czech Republic, Romania and Slovakia) was mainly related to overflows from traffic avoiding Ukrainian airspace. The shift in traffic patterns following the start of the Ukrainian crisis and the downing of MH17 in July 2014 led to a drastic reduction of traffic in Ukraine (-33.4%) and also Moldova (-19.3%) compared to 2014. The sustained closure of Libyan airspace (as of August 2014) continued to have a notable impact on Greece with traffic flows between Europe and Africa shifting from Maltese airspace to Greek airspace. 



After the best year on record in 2013, arrival punctuality in Europe decreased for the second year in a row to 82.1% in 2015. Reactionary delay remains the largest single delay group (45.9%) in 2015, followed by delays due to turnaround issues. The further increase in en-route and airport ATFM delays in 2015 contributed also to the lower punctuality levels in 2015. 



The variability of operations determines the level of predictability and has an impact on airline scheduling and also on the provision of ATC and airport capacity (i.e. TMA capacity, en-route capacity, gate availability, etc.). The lower the predictability, the more difficult it is to match capacity to demand without inefficiencies in terms of delay (insufficient capacity) or cost (underutilisation of resources). Whereas a certain level of variability is considered to be normal or even required in aviation, more research to better understand the drivers of operational variability within the system (operational planning, time definitions, tolerance windows, delay causes, etc.) could contribute to reducing system-wide variability with associated positive effects for capacity utilisation. 



Aircraft noise has been generally recognised as the most significant environmental impact at airports. Political decisions on environmental constraints can impact operations in terms of the number of movements, route design, runway configuration and usage and aircraft mix (engine types, etc.). The main contributing factors towards reduced noise exposure are expected to come from measures with long lead times outside the control of ANS (land use planning, reduction of noise at source). Noise abatement operational procedures are the main area where ANS can actively contribute to the reduction and/or reshaping of the noise contour and the population affected by aviation noise. 



The environmental impact of aviation on climate results from greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions including CO2, NOX, and contrails (H2O), formed by aircraft engine exhaust. By far the main contribution to decouple aviation emissions growth from air traffic growth is expected to come from alternative low carbon fuels, market based measures, technology developments (more efficient aircraft, advances in airframe and engine technology) and subsequent fleet renewals. The ANS-related impact on climate is closely linked to operational performance, which is largely driven by inefficiencies in the four dimensional trajectory and associated fuel burn (and emissions). 



The total economic evaluation of ANS performance presents a consolidated view of direct ANS costs and estimated indirect ANS-related costs (ATFM delays, additional taxi-out and ASMA time, horizontal en-route flight efficiency) borne by airspace users. Based on the latest available information for 2015, total economic ANS-related costs in the SES area are estimated to increase by 4.8% compared to 2014. The increase is mainly driven by the deterioration of ANS-related operational performance in all areas (most notably in en-route and airport ATFM delays) and the projected increase in en-route ANS costs in 2015.

The definition and guidance on the development of Acceptable Levels of Safety Performance (ALoSP) is currently not available in Europe. While there is an urgent need to provide this type of support and guidance to States, it is still not clear how this concept will be introduced within the regulatory environment. A common approach to measuring and managing safety performance from a regulatory perspective would also ensure a harmonised implementation of State Safety Programmes (SSP) and facilitate the exchange of safety information in the future. 



The current safety reporting environment is changing and it has to be accepted that the next few years will be a transition phase. During this time, in order to maintain and improve European reporting, it is important that actors responsible for the collection of safety data work together in order to create an optimum solution. 



Nevertheless, the PRC has to express its concern that during this transition phase, availability, completeness and quality of safety data may deteriorate due to the lack of arrangements between all parties involved in the process.



 



Operational En-route ANS Performance (2015)



The growth in traffic (1.5% from 2014) was not homogenous throughout the network, with significant disruption to traffic flows because of, inter alia, the continuing Ukrainian crisis and industrial action by air traffic controllers. The temporal spread of traffic was also interesting and 2015 witnessed the highest individual monthly totals for network traffic in July, August & September for ten years. 



After the lowest level of en-route ATFM delay per flight on record in 2013, delays have been rising again over the past two years. In 2015, total en-route ATFM delays for the EUROCONTROL area increased by +23% which corresponds to 0.73 minutes of en-route ATFM delay per flight (0.61 in 2014). 



The performance deterioration was mainly attributed to ATC capacity issues highlighting previous PRC concerns that ATFM delays could increase when traffic grows again. 



As stressed already previously by the PRC, in view of the considerable lead times it is essential to carefully plan and also deploy capacity in line with projected traffic growth. Over-conservative capacity planning removes buffers against traffic variations and increases the risk of significant disruption to aircraft operations. 



While capacity constraints can occur from time to time, area control centres (ACCs) should not generate high delays on a regular basis. The most constraining ACCs in 2015 were Nicosia, Brest, Athinai and Macedonia, Zagreb, Lisbon, Reims and Barcelona. Together, they accounted for 58.1% of all en-route ATFM delays but only 14.5% of total flight hours controlled in Europe. 



Despite further progress in the implementation of free route airspace in 2015 (more than 20 airspace improvement packages in 2015), horizontal en-route flight efficiency deteriorated in 2015 after the continuous improvement over the past years. At European level, the inefficiency in filed flight plans increased from 4.70% to 4.74% in 2015. Inefficiencies in actual trajectories increased at a slightly higher rate from 2.72% to 2.77% in 2015. 



Horizontal en-route flight efficiency improves notably on weekends, which is to some extent linked to lower traffic levels which appear to have a positive effect on flight efficiency but also due to the better availability of segregated and free route airspace on weekends, which are contributing factors towards improved flight efficiency. 



In view of the numerous factors and complexities involved, and with traffic levels growing again, flight efficiency improvements will become more and more challenging and will require the continued joint efforts of all stakeholders, coordinated by the Network Manager. 



Close civil military cooperation and coordination is a crucial enabler to improve capacity and flight efficiency performance. Although all EUROCONTROL Member States declare to be formally compliant with existing FUA legislation, the results of the civil military coordination and cooperation questionnaire suggest that there is scope for improvement in the underlying processes related to the management of the airspace. 



The main identified issues are related to the lack of impact assessments; the definition of clear national strategic objectives at ASM level 1, and the interrupted information flow between the three levels of ASM.





In 2015, controlled movements (arrival + departure) at the top 30 airports in terms of traffic increased for the second year in a row. Overall, average daily movements increased by +2.3% compared to 2014 but with notable differences in growth between airports. Despite the further growth in 2014, traffic levels still remain 1.1% below the pre-economic crisis levels of 2008. 



At the same time passenger numbers continued to increase at a higher rate than flights. Compared to 2014, the number of passengers at the top 30 airports increased by +5.3%, and, contrary to the number of flights, passenger numbers are 22.5% higher than in 2008. 



Istanbul Sabiha Gökçen and Atatürk airports continued their growth also in 2015 with an increase in average daily traffic of 91 and 67 movements respectively. Over the past 10 years, Istanbul Sabiha Gökçen airport grew at an average annual rate of +29.8% and Istanbul Atatürk at an average rate of 8.2% per year. The continuous strong growth resulted in a substantial increase in airport ATFM arrival delays at the two Istanbul airports in 2015 with a notable impact on the European network. Together, the two airports accounted for 35.7% of all airport ATFM arrival delays in Europe in 2015. The new Istanbul airport presently under construction is expected to improve the situation. The airport is planned to open in different phases with an anticipated capacity for up to six runways, serving 150 million passengers by 2028. 



Other airports with substantial traffic growth in 2015 were Athens (+13.9%), Dublin (+9.8%), London Stansted (+7.5%), Madrid (+7.0%), and Lisbon (+6.0%). Of the top 30 airports in terms of traffic in 2015, seven airports showed a traffic decrease. 



Despite a number of disruptive events (e.g. industrial action), the average share of operational cancellations at the analysed airports remained at 1.5% in 2015. 



Overall, the traffic increase appears to have contributed to the higher levels of operational inefficiency at some airports. As a result, all four indicators measuring operational ANS performance at the top 30 airports showed performance deterioration in 2015. 



The top 30 European airports accounted for 45.7% of total European airport movements and 88.7% of total airport ATFM arrival delays in 2015. Despite a higher number of regulated flights, ATFM slot adherence continued to improve in 2015, particularly due to a notable improvement at London Heathrow. 



Although not included in the top 30, it is noteworthy to point out that a number of small Greek airports accounted for 5.1% of European airport arrival ATFM delays with average delays per arrival of up to 11.5 minutes. Although the traffic volume at those smaller airports is comparatively low, the network impact in terms of reactionary delay is significant. 



The poor performance at Greek regional airports is linked to seasonal traffic in summer. It and was already observed in 2011 when the Network Management Unit successfully worked together with those airports to improve performance. It would be important to revive the measures applied in 2012 in order to avoid high delay levels in 2016. 



In order to address a growing stakeholder interest, vertical flight efficiency performance on climb and descent operations at 15 selected airports was measured. This first high-level analysis of continuous climb and descent operations revealed notable performance differences among airports which should be investigated further. The observed differences are caused by a number of reasons including congested airspace, restrictions from neighbouring ANSPs, and traffic density.



 



ANS Cost-efficiency (2014)

PRR 2015 analyses performance in 2015 for all KPIs, except for cost-efficiency, which analyses performance in 2014 as this is the latest year for which actual financial data are available. On the other hand, PRR 2015 also presents an outlook for 2015-2019 in terms of cost-efficiency trends. 



The Pan-European system (38 States) en-route cost-efficiency performance in 2014 improved for the second year in a row. Following the -3.3% decrease in 2013, real en-route unit costs decreased further reaching 50.5€2009 per service unit which corresponds to a -5.0% reduction compared to 2013. 



The overall reduction of real en-route unit costs in 2014 is mainly due to the notable traffic growth (+5.9%) while actual en-route ANS costs increased by +0.6% during the same time. Despite the substantial traffic growth in 2014, it is worth noting that en-route service units are still below the forecasted level for 2014. 



In 2014, operating costs accounted for 82% of en-route costs (staff costs for 58% and other operating costs for 24%), followed by depreciation (12%) and cost of capital (6%). Year-on-year, staff costs remained almost stable (+0.4% vs. 2013) while other operating costs increased by +1.8% in 2014. 



The evaluation of differences in trends and behaviour between those States operating in the context of the SES Regulations and the other states in the Route Charges System does not yet show a clear cut trend and it is likely that a longer period would need to be considered. Moreover, the trend in non-SES States is to a large extent influenced by Turkey for which a significantly high traffic growth has been observed over the past years. 



Under the determined costs method, applied by SES States as of 2012, the amounts ultimately paid by airspace users differ from the actual costs due to the traffic risk sharing, cost-sharing, and other adjustments provided in the Charging Regulation. It is therefore important to monitor not only the actual costs incurred by States/ANSPs, but also the amounts ultimately charged to the airspace users in respect of the activities of that year (a concept also referred to as the “true cost for users”). In 2014, the “true costs for users” were +2.8% higher than the actual costs of States/ANSPs but -2.1% lower than the determined costs provided for 2014 in the RP1 performance plans, which suggests that the service providers were able to adjust their costs downwards in line with the lower than predicted traffic level in 2014. 



The outlook for 2015-2019 suggests that the en-route unit cost is expected to decrease from 50.5€2009 in 2014 to 46.4€2009 in 2019, representing a decrease of -1.7% p.a. on average until 2019. Overall, at Pan-European level between 2009 and 2019, the trend in total en-route costs is planned to remain flat, while traffic (SUs) is planned to increase by some +31%, implying substantial cost-efficiency improvements over this 10-years cycle. 



European terminal ANS cost-efficiency performance (29 states comprising 33 Terminal Charging Zones which include a total of 230 airports in 2014) followed a similar pattern as observed for en-route cost efficiency in 2014. Year-on-year, terminal ANS unit costs decreased by -2.3% versus 2013 due to terminal service units (TNSUs) growing stronger (+2.9% vs. 2013) than real terminal ANS costs (+0.6% vs. 2013). 



The outlook for 2015-2019 suggests that SES total terminal ANS costs are planned to slightly decrease over the period 2015-2019 (i.e. on average by -0.5% p.a.), while TNSUs are foreseen to increase at an average rate of +2.0% per year, representing a decrease of -2.5% per year on average in the terminal ANS unit costs. This is a slightly better trend than for en-route. 



Detailed benchmarking analysis focusing on ANSPs cost-efficiency at Pan-European system shows that the gateto-gate unit economic costs decreased for the 4th year in a row to reach an amount of €479 per composite flighthour in 2014, which is the lowest level achieved since the start of the ACE benchmarking analysis in 2001. This performance improvement mainly reflects a decrease in unit ATM/CNS provision costs (-1.9%) while the unit costs of ATFM delays rose by 11.4% compared to 2013. 



Overall, despite the impact of the economic recession of the ATM industry in 2009, the cost-effectiveness performance of the Pan-European system significantly improved since 2004. Indeed, in 2014 unit ATM/CNS provision costs are -9.4% lower than in 2004. This performance improvement should be seen in the light of the cost-containment measures initiated in 2009-2010 which continued to generate savings years after their implementation, and for the ANSPs operating in SES States, the implementation of the performance scheme which contributed to maintain a downward pressure on costs during RP1.",air-traffic

"The Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) announced today that it has successfully commenced a number of trials using SAAB engineered remote tower technology to provide air traffic control services for Cork and Shannon airports from Dublin. 

 

“As part of our strategy to provide safe, innovative and cost effective Air Traffic Services, we are validating the concept of providing Air Traffic Control Services at Shannon and Cork airports from a central control room in Dublin. We are very pleased to announce that the first of these trials has been successful and we will continue in our efforts to realise the potential of this technology. There are many critical areas to be addressed and these trials are a significant milestone in proving the reliability and integrity of these systems. Remote tower technology will play a vital role in the future of air traffic service provision for low density aerodromes in Ireland.” said Billy Hann, General Manager of Terminal Services Operations.



Remotely operated towers offer significant potential to assist air navigation service providers (ANSPs) such as the IAA to reduce and control their costs in line with airline and European Commission expectations, whilst maintaining safety and service delivery. This potential is greatest at smaller, less busy regional airports where the volume of traffic is likely to be insufficient to cover the costs of service provision at a user charge that is sustainable from the customers’ perspective.

"The European ARIADNA consortium led by Indra and integrated by CRIDA, ENAIRE and Fada-Catec has completed the first simultaneous flight tests in a conventional airport of a drone or remotely piloted aircraft (RPAS/UAS) in the presence of a manned aircraft.

This is one of the first flying experiences undertaken in Europe for a drone to be able to operate in the area of the traffic of a conventional airdrome. The European ARIADNA project thus allows further progress in integrating these aircrafts in non-segregated airspace, i.e. in the same space used by manned aircrafts

Additionally, success in tests is a very important step for the members of the ARIADNA project, which are positioned at the forefront in the area of research and development for integration this aircrafts in the air traffic control environment.

The flight program was held at the ATLAS Experimental Flight Center, located in Villacarrillo (Jaen). This center has an associated airspace that can be segregated for such operations.

The exercises were carried out in two distinct phases. In the first, a drone, called Viewer, flew executing various maneuvers on the airfield while the Indra MRI P2006T manned aircraft operated simultaneously.

A controller supervised the operation, as you would do in a real situation, giving separation instructions to the aircrafts. The drone's remote pilot, which monitors the aircraft from the ground at all times, had the position data of both aircrafts provided by an ADS-B receptor, thus improving situational awareness of traffic in the area.

Another drone was used in the second phase of flights — the unmanned helicopter Logo— with which the feasibility of instrumental approach and landing procedures with vertical guidance based on satellite navigation was validated. The ability of these aircrafts to operate at an airport under the same conditions as other aircrafts was thus demonstrated.

The ARIADNA project has been developed by a consortium of companies and institutions in the Spanish aeronautical sector, composed of Indra as coordinator and industrial partner of RPAs; ENAIRE as manager of Air Navigation in Spain; CRIDA, as a research center in air traffic management; and FADA-CATEC, as a research center and RPAs operator.

The project is one of several demonstrations co-funded by the SESAR Joint Undertaking aimed at safely integrating drones into the European ATM system. SESAR (Single European Sky Air Traffic Management Research) was set up to modernise and harmonise ATM systems through the definition, development and deployment of innovative technological and operational solutions. Established in 2007, the SESAR Joint Undertaking (SJU) is a public-private partnership which pools the knowledge and resources of the entire ATM community in order to define, research, develop and validate SESAR Solutions. Founded by the European Union and Eurocontrol, the SJU currently has 15 members who together with their partners and affiliate associations represent over 80 companies working in Europe and beyond. The SESAR JU also works closely with staff associations, regulators, airport operators, and the scientific community. In 2014, the SESAR Deployment Manager (SDM), comprised of air navigation service providers, airlines and the SESAR-related Deployment Airport Operators Group (SDAG), coordinates the implementation of the EU’s Pilot Common Project, the first set of SESAR Solutions to be deployed in a synchronised and timely manner across Europe.",air-traffic
"As of 3 May 2016, ATCOs from the 5 French ACCs can provide ATC instruction of frequency transfer via data link to all equipped aircraft above FL 195 (6 000 meters). 



Air-ground data link communication is the baseline of advanced automated functions under development by the SESAR program. With data link, ATM will be safer and more efficient in particular via a reduction of the number of repetitive messages and a frequency transfer at the most appropriate moment as well as the use of pre-formatted messages for air-ground exchanges.



 In France, controller pilot data link communication (CPDLC) services are implemented in several phases. A first set of 3 services (air-initiated log on, microphone check and frequency transfer) already available since September 2015 in Bordeaux and Brest ACCs is now implemented at Paris, 



Reims and Aix-en-Provence ACCs which means that France is supporting frequency transfer by data link in all upper airspace.

For ARINC equipped aircraft, the service will be available in March 2017.",air-traffic
"Aviators are reminded that almost 180 ground-based navigation aids and associated non-precision approach procedures will be withdrawn from service this week after Australia earlier this year moved to more accurate, mandated satellite navigation technology.

The move on 26 May will see the Airservices Navigation Rationalisation Project switch-off 179 navigation aids, including non-directional beacons, VHF omni-directional radio ranges and distance measuring equipment. Withdrawn procedures will be replaced with straight-in area navigation (RNAV) approach procedures that perform the same function. At many airports, RNAV approach procedures will be provided at both ends of the runway, essentially duplicating the navigation service.

Many of the ground-based navaids have been maintained beyond their expected operational life and advances in aeronautical technology have rendered most of them obsolete.

The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also required from 4 February that instrument flight rules (IFR) aircraft use Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) technology as their primary means of navigation. GNSS is a key component of a long-term strategy to address growth in aviation.

Airservices consulted extensively on the changes and in May issued three types of Notices to Airmen (NOTAMS) alerting operators to the progressive shutdown from 4am (AEST) on 26 May.

Turning off the navaids will take about six weeks and the NOTAMs advise that the aids should not be used for navigation purposes even though they may still be transmitting an IDENT.

The navaid information has been removed from Aeronautical Information Publications in the 26 May edition. Where a navaid is the only service at a location, the location will be removed. In cases where other services are provided the location will remain but information relating to the navaid will be removed.

Benefits of the switch to satellite navigation include a reduced requirement to use ground-based aids, greater operational flexibility, and reduced track miles, step-down and circling approaches, as well as reduced fuel burn and flight times.

Airservices will monitor the remaining 213 navigation aids forming the industry-selected Backup Navigation Network (BNN) which will be available in the unlikely event a pilot is unable to access the satellite service.

"Aireon LLC has announced the successful completion of a service delivery point Factory Acceptance Test with the Irish Aviation Authority (IAA), Ireland’s Air Navigation Service Provider (ANSP). The test confirmed that the IAA’s service delivery equipment, a critical component for receiving global air traffic surveillance data, is performing to rigorous standards. This is the first major step towards deploying space-based ADS-B in Irish airspace, in addition to implementing Aireon Aircraft Locating and Emergency Response Tracking (ALERT) service, Aireon’s free global emergency-tracking service hosted and operated by the IAA.

Completion of this first milestone clears the path for the additional steps needed to integrate space-based ADS-B data into an operational setting and provide Aireon ALERT to the world’s aviation stakeholders, including ANSPs, airlines, regulators and search and rescue organizations. The Factory Acceptance Test verified the system functionality and assembly. It also measured the associated hardware design elements. Aireon and the IAA are working towards additional milestones over the next 18 months, including Site Acceptance Testing, which will verify the system functionality, and Implementation Service Acceptance Testing to verify the accuracy of the data.

“This first milestone marks a significant advancement for the IAA in deploying space-based ADS-B in Irish airspace. This also moves us one step closer to rolling out Aireon ALERT to the world’s aviation stakeholders and search and rescue organizations,” said Peter Kearney, Director ATM Strategy and Operations, IAA. “With the success of the Factory Acceptance Test, we are moving towards providing this free public service for registered aviation stakeholders – with real-time tracking data -- the likes of which have never been available globally to the industry before. Our engineering team is rapidly working to ensure that Aireon ALERT will be fully operational in when it’s time to go live in 2018.”

“IAA is a globally recognized leader of air traffic management services, one of the key Aireon launch customers and also the host of Aireon ALERT. This is a major step in ensuring a secure and safe connection between Aireon’s system and the IAA,” said Vincent Capezzuto, Chief Technology Officer and Vice President of Engineering, Aireon. “We will now be preparing for the first Iridium NEXT launch with SpaceX, scheduled for this summer, the IAA Site Acceptance Test, which will prove that ANSPs are able to receive global space-based ADS-B data at remote service delivery points and will meet all of the surveillance requirements. These are critical milestones, and we are well on our way to being operational in 2018.”

Aireon ALERT will be the only free service providing global coverage and GPS location and real-time tracking data to assist rescue coordination centers in emergency situations. Through a 24/7 communications facility, operated by the IAA at its North Atlantic Communications centre in Ballygirreen, Ireland, Aireon ALERT will make it possible to precisely query the location and flight track of any ADS-B equipped aircraft flying in distress.",air-traffic
"One of the most comprehensive surveys of airline customers worldwide reveals that passengers now not only expect broadband services to be offered as standard during flights, but more than half would prefer in-flight connectivity to in-flight meals.

The In-Flight Connectivity Survey was conducted by Inmarsat (LSE: ISAT.L), the leading provider of global mobile satellite communications services, and market research company GfK between August 2015 and March 2016. Responses were gathered from more than 9,000 passengers in Europe, Asia, Australasia, and Central and South America who had taken a short, medium or long haul flight in the past year and carried at least one personal device onboard the aircraft.

Passenger reliance on remaining online using their smartphones, tablets and other devices now means that most travellers (83%) will select an airline based on whether they can remain logged into social networks, video streaming sites, apps and emails throughout their journeys. In addition, passengers are willing to pay to receive the best possible service.

The survey also found that most passengers would prefer to connect their smartphones, tablets or laptops to the internet during their journey as opposed to eating a meal, accessing in-flight entertainment or experiencing duty free shopping.

In terms of deciding whether to connect to broadband onboard an aircraft, of upmost concern to passengers is reliability, as identified by 75% of respondents, over speed which was a priority for just 19%. Among those who have had the opportunity to use in-flight broadband, one in ten were unable to connect their devices to the aircraft’s network.

Quality is therefore the essential factor for passengers in determining whether to use in-flight broadband. 60% of passengers are less inclined to connect if the service is poor, but a reliable service that does not disconnect at regular intervals can expect to be well used.

The proliferation of electronic portable devices means that passengers expect in-flight broadband to replicate the same levels of connectivity they experience when browsing on the ground. Furthermore, demand for onboard connectivity is not just restricted to long-haul travel, passengers are equally willing to pay to log-in whether they are flying short distances (64%), medium haul (68%) or long haul (69%).

Passengers across the world have different needs when it comes to in-flight broadband, with those in Latin America primarily looking to connect in order to stream video as a priority. They are also most likely to think in-flight connectivity will usurp in-flight entertainment.

Asia Pacific passengers mainly seek access to travel websites and apps. European travellers, who are used to onboard connectivity everywhere they go, want to be able to keep up-to-date and in constant contact with friends and family whenever they travel on flights.

The Inmarsat In-Flight Connectivity Survey highlights airline passengers’ increasing reliance on connectivity wherever and whenever they fly and there is clear indication that this level of demand is set to continue in the future.

Additional information on the survey, including white papers, infographics and regional break-downs for Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America, are available on Inmarsat’s website.

Leo Mondale, President of Inmarsat Aviation,said: “Demand for broadband in the sky has reached such unprecedented levels around the world that airlines, as well as those in the business aviation and aircraft lessor markets, need to meet passenger expectations or risk losing out to their competitors.

“Our survey clearly demonstrates that passengers demand a highly reliable service. Quality is the essential ingredient that determines whether or not passengers choose to go online during flights. Airlines are therefore under pressure to select the right partner to support them in delivering a reliable and cost effective service. Inmarsat has the infrastructure, commitment and investment power to deliver the best capacity, now and in the future.”

Inmarsat recently unveiled an aviation broadband roadmap to ensure that rising demand for fast, reliable and global in-flight connectivity is met for the next five years and beyond. The launch of its Global Xpress (GX) Aviation service this year creates the world’s first high-speed passenger broadband solution with seamless, end-to-end global coverage, delivered through a single operator. Engineered to meet the needs of complex and evolving airline route systems, initial customers include Lufthansa, Singapore Airlines and Jazeera Airways.

The GX network, which entered commercial service with three powerful Ka-band satellites in December 2015, will provide the international bandwidth capacity needed to meet existing and near-term demand from airlines. It also serves as a global coverage underlay that will be built upon as part of the aviation broadband roadmap to meet future demand.

Inmarsat is scheduled to launch its fourth GX satellite, produced by Boeing, later this year and has awarded Airbus Defence and Space a contract to build two additional satellites (Inmarsat-6 F1 and F2) with a Ka-band payload to add depth to its global GX coverage. The first Inmarsat-6 satellite is scheduled for delivery by the close of the decade.

Another vital component in the roadmap is Inmarsat’s European Aviation Network, which will be the first aviation passenger connectivity solution across European airspace to integrate an advanced satellite network and LTE-based ground network; the latter will be operated by Deutsche Telekom. The first commercial EAN trials are expected in mid-2017.",air-traffic
"German manufacturers G&D feel very much at home in especially safety-related control rooms. For decades, their products have been proving their high quality in these environments. But the use of KVM does not only significantly improve the operating sequences. Sophisticated redundancy concepts make the entire installation absolutely fail-proof.

KVM technology plays an integral part with regard to safe and easy-to-operate system structures. The abbreviation KVM means keyboard, video and mouse and stands as a synonym for computer interfaces. The special feature about this technology: Based on hardware, KVM systems pick up computer signals at the interfaces from where they are extended and distributed. The advantage: Computers can be operated without any delays even over great distances and from different workplaces while, at the same time, users are able to operate multiple systems with only one set of keyboard, mouse and monitor. And all of the above works independently of any operating systems or additional software.

The first advantage lies in the optimized operation. KVM systems make it possible, for example, to keep an overview of multiple systems on multiple screens as is typical for applications in control rooms. The fact that individual systems do not require an individual set of keyboard and mouse comes as a big advantage and keeps the workplace clearly arranged. The desired computers can be manually selected by pressing a key or intuitively via G&D’s CrossDisplay-Switching: Here, the KVM system simply follows the mouse pointer. When moving the cursor across the edge of a screen, CrossDisplay-Switching switches the focus of keyboard and mouse to the computer source of the adjoining screen.

With such features, simplified operation already offers the first big plus with regard to safety: Users are able to quickly access their systems at all times.

But when it comes to safety, systems from G&D have much more in store. First there are the KVM components per se. G&D does not make any compromises with regard to quality. Thus, all newly developed systems have to run through comprehensive tests, which ensure that any novelties can be operated reliably once they are launched. The parts of the on-going manufacturing must undergo an end test as well to maintain the consistent high standard. To make sure that the products are ready to be operated 24/7 over many years, the company has been certified according to DIN ISO 9001:2008 – a standard that cannot be taken for granted even for products made in Germany.

For mission-critical applications G&D have further expanded their portfolio to include even more safety features. Thus, their systems provide comprehensive monitoring functions. These functions do not only monitor the KVM system, but are also able to detect if the connected computers are powered on and if a video signal is available. In case the video signal fails, G&D systems always provide the image last displayed on the monitor. This way users are able to provisionally continue their work with static information instead of having to wait in front of a blank screen.

To ensure absolutely fail-proof systems, KVM installations offer the great possibility of establishing consistent redundancies. G&D have developed these concepts as part of a long cooperation with Air Traffic Controls, but also in applications in traffic management or emergency services.

The easiest concept can already be implemented by using a KVM switch: The switch lets you connect a primary and a redundant installation without the need of an additional software layer. Within a split second users can now switch to the redundant system simply by pressing a button. Expanded concepts even carry out such processes automatically.

But even with complex systems, G&D offer comprehensive options to establish redundancies. By now, KVM matrix installations are applied frequently in control rooms. Here, multiple computers and workstations are connected to a central switch. Thus, the system becomes more flexible since each workstation has access to each computer. This facilitates the cooperation between team members because it is possible to share screen contents, hand over processes to colleagues and implement large screen projections.

However, such a central switch might be considered a single point of failure. But it doesn’t have to be! G&D components make it easy to establish redundant clusters. This means that the computer signals can be distributed to two simultaneously working matrix systems. If one of the systems fails, the other one takes over. A recently implemented function called “Auto-Switching to Alive Cluster” automatically switches the user console to the backup installation in case the system fails.

Overall, G&D KVM systems offer many possibilities to not only make the operation for users in control rooms significantly easier. Furthermore, even complex installations can be designed in an absolutely fail-proof way. The team of G&D will gladly advise their customers on the best solution to reach their individual goals. In addition to other events, the company will present their equipment at the Critical Communications World in Amsterdam, 31/05 - 02/06/2016.

Operation without distraction: The CrossDisplay switching from G&D doesn’t

stop at unusual monitor configurations and multihead graphics cards. This

means that the user can work intuitively, as the switching process simply

follows the mouse pointer. For even greater control, the systems can also be

several systems from one single workplace. Thus, users can simply be switched

to a redundant system without having to interrupt them in their work.

"Earlier this month Milan Linate airport became the 20th fully implemented A-CDM Airport. In taking this important step Milan Linate has joined the family of airports fully integrated into the European ATM network.

These airports currently represent 28% of departure traffic in the Network Manager area. By the end of 2016, EUROCONTROL, as Network Manager, expects to have integrated three more airports, representing a total of 32 % of departure traffic, with further airports bringing the number to 47% by the end of 2017.

Milan Linate is the fourth Italian CDM airport, joining Rome Fiumicino, Milan Malpensa and Venice Marco Polo. Naples will be the next, in mid-2017. The strong presence of General and Business Aviation at Linate, which is quite challenging in terms of predictability, has required additional effort in the tuning of the system and operational procedures.

The other A-CDM airports are: Barcelona, Berlin Schoenefeld, Brussels, Düsseldorf, Frankfurt, Geneva, Helsinki, London Gatwick, London Heathrow, Madrid, Munich, Oslo, Paris CDG, Prague, Stuttgart and Zurich.



A-CDM Impact Assessment report



In March Eurocontrol published a report, A-CDM impact Assessment. The report presents an up-to-date evaluation of the impact of A-CDM implementation at local/airport level as well as at network level considering 17 fully implemented CDM airports. 



Below you can find the executive summary from the report and at the foot of this article there is a link to the complete 160 page report.



Executive Summary



The Airport Collaborative Decision Making (A-CDM) is a EUROCONTROL concept which has now been implemented at 18 European airports. Over 34% of ECAC departures now originate from a CDM airport and transmit improved pre-departure take-off time estimations to NMOC via Departure Planning Information (DPI) messages. CDM airports realise significant local operational benefits through the adoption of A-CDM processes, not to mention a dramatic improvement in levels of takeoff predictability. This improved predictability is an enabler for a safer and more efficient European ATM network.



 The objectives of this study have been to collect evidence from 17 CDM airports so that:



From a local perspective, the partnership with each CDM airport has allowed the local A-CDM impact assessment to be focused on generating credible operational benefits of each implementation. This included data analysis of airport and NMOC flight data as well as operational review meetings in which qualitative and quantitative benefits were relayed by airports and A-CDM stakeholders. A-CDM supports strong taxi-out time and ATFM delay reductions. The following infographic describes the total savings generated across 17 CDM airports, based on taxi-out and ATFM delay improvements.







The impact of A-CDM on local ATFM delay should not be underestimated. CDM airports have shown a much stronger tendency for generating more favourable slots for its customers, resulting in ii | P a g e significant ground delay savings. Several CDM airports showed tactical delay cost savings amounting to near €1 million in 2015, including some of the lesser constrained CDM airports such as Prague, Venice and Milan Malpensa. 



Local benefits that have been confirmed as part of the study (but not necessarily existing at each CDM airport) include:



The realisation of local benefits depends on the characteristics of the airport and the extent to which A-CDM procedures are adopted. However, this study has shown that even the lesser constrained airports stand to benefit significantly from A-CDM, particularly during periods of adverse conditions. 



Assuming a full implementation cost of €2.5 million and annual maintenance costs of €150,000 - this study has shown that on average, A-CDM provides a return on investment after 18 months, and a cost benefit ratio (CBR) of 7 over 10 years. This considers the tactical cost savings to airline operators only and not the financial benefits enjoyed by other partners – which are more difficult to verify. Clearly, a full cost avoidance analysis that includes the benefits enjoyed by ANSP, ground handlers and the airport operator would generate a significantly higher CBR. 



From a network perspective, this study investigated how the continued implementation of A-CDM would impact the European ATM network in terms of safety, enroute capacity and ATFM delay. It concludes that:



A historical analysis of CDM airport ATFM delay performance has shown that:



Atlas Chase and EUROCONTROL would like to thank all participating CDM airports for their time and assistance in developing this report. It is hoped that the information presented herein will support other airports in their road towards A-CDM implementation and that the achievements of current CDM airports have been communicated objectively.

"Three quarters of all airlines are satisfied or very satisfied with the services provided by the German air navigation service provider, DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung GmbH, and its partners in the Functional Airspace Block Europe Central (FABEC). This is the result of a customer survey that was recently conducted. Compared with the previous survey, DFS has further improved in the fields of safety, capacity and efficient routing, achieving marks above the average of FABEC's overall result.

The primary focus was on the safe and orderly handling of air traffic. Eighty-four percent of the customers are satisfied or very satisfied with the performance. However, punctuality and cost-efficiency also play an important role. The recent FABEC survey shows that the air navigation service providers were rated good to very good in these fields, too.

About 100 airlines, which generate 85 percent of the revenue from air navigation charges within FABEC, were surveyed. The largest airlines include Air France, Easyjet, KLM, Lufthansa and SWISS.

The airlines, too, used the survey to formulate their suggestions for improvements in terms of airspace capacity and cost-efficiency. Concerns were expressed, in particular, about the ability of air navigation service providers to provide sufficient capacity for potential increases in traffic.

The previous FABEC-wide customer satisfaction survey was conducted in 2012/2013. The results of such surveys are taken as a basis for action plans used by air navigation service providers and within FABEC to improve their services.

In the Functional Airspace Block Europe Central (FABEC), DFS works together with the air navigation service providers of Belgium, France, Luxembourg, Switzerland, and the Netherlands, as well as with the EUROCONTROL Centre in Maastricht. Approximately 5.6 million flights are controlled in the entire FABEC airspace per year.",air-traffic
"A first for the UK – Rohde & Schwarz has successfully installed and commissioned three fully IP-based R&S VCS-4G voice communications systems for Highlands & Islands Airports Limited (HIAL) at Stornoway, Benbecula and Wick Airports. All three systems support the provision of a combined aerodrome and procedural service.

Munich, June 21, 2016 – The volume of air traffic at HIAL’s airports has gradually increased over recent years and the airports have become increasingly important to the economy of the highland and island region. In order to maintain its high standard of air traffic service provision, HIAL decided to replace the legacy voice communications systems (VCS) at Stornoway, Benbecula and Wick Airports. HIAL was looking to purchase new state-of-the-art digital VCSs that could successfully interface with the airports’ existing communications infrastructures and provide the airports with a future-ready and cost-effective solution. 

 

 Following a competitive tender process, Rohde & Schwarz UK was awarded the contract to supply the three new all IP VCSs. The Rohde & Schwarz engineering team, with the assistance of the HIAL project team, has now successfully implemented this cost-effective solution to HIAL’s challenging technical and operational requirements. The system is the first of its kind in the UK and has been installed at all three airports. 

 

 Robin MacRae, Head of Operations at Highlands and Islands Airports Limited, commented that Rohde & Schwarz has successfully completed a challenging project at three airports that meets HIAL’s technical and operational requirements. The fact that the standard R&S VCS-4G system  uses an open architecture and standard interfaces allows HIAL to easily integrate future data applications, making the system viable for years to come. 

 

 Voice over IP in line with EUROCAE ED-137B standards has now established itself as the communications technology of choice for progressive air navigation service providers (ANSP). The R&S VCS-4G uses a redundant design that is able to interface with legacy equipment such as voice recorders, analog radios and telephone lines. This allows ANSPs to transition to fully integrated IP-based voice distribution systems over a period of time, which has operational and financial benefits. 

 

 Due to its unique architecture, the system is highly scalable and can be easily expanded without replacing existing equipment. The R&S VCS-4G system has been designed to meet next generation ATC requirements such as asset sharing, facility consolidation, geographical distribution and remote tower technology, providing ANSPs with an effective solution for present and future safety and efficiency objectives in global aviation.",air-traffic
"Portuguese ANSP, NAV Portugal, has selected Comsoft Solutions’ state-of-the-art Surveillance Data Distribution system (SDDS-NG) for advanced data exchange of surveillance data sources for mainland Portugal, the Azores and Madeira.

SDDS-NG is a highly versatile system for the exchange, conversion and distribution of any kind of surveillance data in heterogeneous ATC/ATM environments, while facilitating a uniform connection of all surveillance sensors using the ASTERIX standard.

NAV Portugal is responsible for two Flight Information Regions (FIR), Lisbon FIR with an area above 190,000 NM2 on mainland Portugal and over the Atlantic ocean including also the autonomous region of Madeira and the Santa Maria Oceanic FIR, with an area of almost 1,5 million NM2 over the autonomous region of the Azores and high seas. Three SDDS-NG systems from Comsoft Solutions will be provided to the Portuguese ANSP, with one main and one test system to be located in Lisbon and a third system for Santa Maria in the Azores.

SDDS-NG continues the extensive success of the first generation of Radar Message Conversion and Distribution System (RMCDS) for NATS in the UK and, even more prominently, the flagship product RMCDE, created on behalf of EUROCONTROL. It therefore supports full interoperability with the European Radar Data Network (RADNET).

SDDS-NG is already operational for the Brazilian Airforce (Força Aérea Brasileira - FAB) as a standalone system on 22 radar sites, in Iceland and Estonia within the system deployments of Quadrant and EUROCONTROL’s ARTAS and in Indonesia and Abu Dhabi in the scope of the Prisma ATM systems. The German ANSP DFS is currently deploying a country wide surveillance data network based on SDDS-NG systems scheduled to become operational later this year.",air-traffic
"The International Air Transport Association (IATA) released preliminary analysis of the financial and economic impact of the Brexit decision on the air transport industry.

""The Brexit vote has triggered much uncertainty—financial and otherwise. As leaders in the UK and the EU work to establish a new framework for their relationship, one certainty to guide them is the need and desire of people on both sides of that relationship to travel and trade. Air transport plays a major role in making that possible. There were 117 million air passenger journeys between the UK and the EU in 2015. Air links facilitate business, support jobs and build prosperity. It is critical that whatever form the new UK-EU relationship takes, it must continue to ensure the common interests of safe, secure, efficient and sustainable air connectivity,"" said Tony Tyler, IATA’s Director General and CEO.

"NextGen is bringing new benefits to Los Angeles International Airport through a technology called Data Comm. Data Comm revolutionizes communications between air traffic controllers and pilots by replacing some traditional voice communications with digital information exchanges – like texting versus talking over the phone.

Voice communication is labor intensive, time consuming and can lead to miscommunications known as “talk back, read back” errors. Data Comm, by contrast, enables streamlined, two-way data exchanges between controllers and flight crews for clearances, instructions, advisories, flight crew requests and reports.

By exchanging digital messages, air traffic controllers, pilots and airline operations centers can communicate more clearly and efficiently. Better communication improves controller and pilot productivity, improves safety, can reduce flight delays and can help aircraft fly more direct routes, saving time and fuel and reducing aviation’s impact on the environment. Both U.S. and international carriers are benefiting from Data Comm capabilities at LAX. These include Air New Zealand, Air Tahiti Nui, AirBridge, American, British Airways, Cargolux, Delta, Emirates, Etihad, Executive Jet, FedEx, Hawaiian, Korean, Qatar, Scandinavian, Singapore, Southwest, Sunset, United, UPS and Virgin America, in addition to some general aviation operators.

The FAA began testing Data Comm capabilities and benefits in 2014 at Newark and Memphis with UPS, FedEx and United Airlines along with select international operators. The FAA started deploying Data Comm in air traffic control towers in the fall of 2015 and plans to be using it in more than 50 towers by the end of 2016. The technology will be installed in air traffic control facilities that manage high altitude traffic beginning in 2019.",air-traffic
"On the occasion of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) High Level Meeting on a Global Market Based Measure (MBM) scheme, representatives from the AeroSpace and Defence Industries Association of Europe (ASD) emphasised on the need to tackle the civil aviation CO2 emissions.



 As a member of the International Coordination Council of Aerospace Industries Associations (ICCAIA), ASD is actively engaged in the ICAO debate on a global MBM which is expected to be adopted at the ICAO Assembly in autumn 2016 for implementation from 2020 onwards. As such, a global MBM agreement would pave the way for the European Union to amend its own aviation Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) and align it with the global scheme.



 “The earlier agreement on an ambitious global ICAO aircraft CO2 certification standard together with the planned agreement on a global MBM are of crucial importance. ASD is committed to work on global measures for sustainable aviation” stated Mr Michel Wachenheim, Senior Advisor to the Airbus President & CEO and Chairman of ASD’s Civil Aviation Business Unit. 



In addition, Mr Francis Couillard, Vice President Environment Policies, European and Multilateral Affairs Directorate at Safran and Member of the ASD Environment Commission, highlighted that “the global civil aviation industry has agreed on a pro-active action plan to tackle the impact of civil aviation on climate change based on a four pillar approach (technology, operations, infrastructure and a global market based measure). The goal is to achieve a 1.5% average annual fuel efficiency improvement from 2009 to 2020, to stabilise net aviation CO2 emissions at 2020 levels through carbon neutral growth and to reduce aviation’s net CO2 emissions to 50% of what they were in 2005, by 2050”. 



Europe plays a crucial role to achieve global environmental targets through continued investment into Research and Development based on efficient and grant-based funding mechanisms. This requires sufficient public funding in particular for flagship programmes such as Clean Sky and SESAR. 



“Thanks to continued European technological leadership and the financial support provided by the European Union and National Authorities for R&D funding, each new generation of aircraft is expected to have emissions some 15-20% less than the previous generation” said Mr Vincent De Vroey, ASD Civil Aviation Director. “ASD fully supports the need for a global solution as emissions are a global challenge and civil aviation is a global business. European industry and Authorities should therefore be actively involved in the ongoing ICAO debate. Once ICAO has adopted a global solution, Europe should amend its own aviation ETS and align it with the global scheme” concluded Mr Jan Pie, ASD Secretary General.",air-traffic
"Comsoft Solutions invited their dedicated customers once again to the annual CAUG event in Karlsruhe, Germany, to discuss advances and trends in AIM and AMHS, as well as to talk more about the company’s future plans as a member of the Frequentis Group.

The annual event’s programme aims to enhance the user experience and quality of Comsoft Solutions’ AMHS and AIM product lines AIDA-NG and CADAS, through presentations and discussions that provide an interesting and dynamic dialogue between supplier and user. This year’s theme “Continuity with new Perspectives” set out to highlight that the well-known products and teams would remain, but changes would provide a new outlook and a strong future.

Managing Director Gerald Enzinger opened proceedings; thanking customers and staff for their support, while Comsoft Solutions Head of Sales, Markus Heichel, and Frequentis Head of ATM Solutions, Günter Graf, elaborated on what the future holds for the two market leaders and the benefits for their customers. With over 100 years of technological experience in the AIM/AMHS domain, the advantages of the pairing were obvious, while noting that Comsoft Solutions is an independent company within the Frequentis Group. In the joint presentation, Best of Two Worlds, by Uli Kaage and Joachim Lennarz, both companies could show that the product lines ideally complement each other and how users will benefit from the aligned product portfolio.

As always, CAUG was a platform for users to share know-how and use cases. Valerian Vavro from Slovakian ANSP, LPS, presented their experience with AMHS and connecting to other countries, Alain El Baz, from Swiss Skyguide, spoke about their AMHS renewal strategy and Paul Saccasyn, from EUROCONTROL Network Manager, talked about the rapid evolvement of the AMHS network within Europe over the last few years, also facilitated by PENS. Abdulhakem Ali Al Shawesh from Libyan ANSP, LYCAA, also gave an impressive illustration of how they restored Comsoft Solutions’ literally “bullet-proof” AMHS and AIS equipment in its heavily damaged centre during the civil war.

Finally it could be shown how the large and still growing user community can benefit from standardisation and harmonisation in hardware, software and even the provision of services provided to customers. New Sales and Marketing Director, Christoph Aschauer, summed up the event with a strong message about collaboration and working together for a shared goal for improved productivity and performance, utilising synergies for the benefit of the whole community.

CAUG launched in 2007 in order to support AIM and AMHS advancements to users. Next year will celebrate a decade of CAUG and will take place on May 16-17, 2017.",air-traffic
"The FAA and its government partners are expanding research on ways to detect “rogue” drones around airports.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and its government, industry and academia partners have joined forces to evaluate drone detection technology at John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) in New York.

Over the last two years, the FAA has received numerous reports from pilots and residents about unmanned aircraft systems – UAS, or “drones” – around some of the nation’s busiest airports, including JFK.

“We face many difficult challenges as we integrate rapidly evolving UAS technology into our complex and highly regulated airspace,” said Marke “Hoot” Gibson, FAA Senior Advisor on UAS Integration. “This effort at JFK reflects everyone’s commitment to safety.”

Beginning May 2, the FAA conducted evaluations at JFK to study the effectiveness of a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) UAS detection system in a commercial airport environment.  Five different rotorcraft and fixed wing UAS participated in the evaluations, and about 40 separate tests took place.

The JFK evaluation involved extensive government inter-agency collaboration, and cooperation from industry and academia. The tests expanded on research performed earlier this year at Atlantic City International Airport.

In addition to the FAA and the FBI, the agencies combining forces in this research included the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Department of Justice, Queens District Attorney’s Office and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. DHS and the FBI want to identify unauthorized UAS operators for law enforcement purposes, and the FAA’s mission is to provide a safe and efficient airport environment for both manned and unmanned air traffic.

“We applaud the FBI and FAA for their efforts to detect and track unmanned aerial systems (UAS),” said Thomas Bosco, Port Authority Aviation Director.  “We look forward to supporting continued U.S. Government efforts to identify and deploy countermeasures to neutralize the threat posed by rogue UASs.”

The team evaluating the FBI’s detection system also included contributions from one of the six FAA-designated UAS test sites. The Griffiss International Airport test site in Rome, NY, provided expertise in planning the individual tests as well as the flight commander for the tests and two of the UAS used.

The FY 2016 Appropriations law mandates that the FAA continue research into detection of UAS in airport environments. The agency is continuing to formulate an inter-agency strategy to evaluate detection systems in a variety of airport environments.",air-traffic

"Fifty ministers of transport from countries around the world are gathering in Leipzig for the International Transport Forum Summit, the theme of which is ‘green and inclusive transport’. At the ministerial opening session today, Tony Tyler, Director General and CEO of the International Air Transport Association delivered a message on behalf of the global aviation industry:

“We came together in 2009 to launch the first climate goals for any global transport sector. We need your help this year with our mid-term goal to cap net aviation CO2 emissions from 2020. The industry is looking to government ministers in this room to support the ICAO work on developing a global offsetting scheme for international aviation.”

“A well-designed global offsetting scheme will help us to balance our climate responsibilities with a pragmatic, simple and cost-effective international solution. As a sector, we take pride in our ability to collaborate. It is one of the ways in which we have grown such an enviable record in safety. On this issue too, we collaborate. Day-in, day-out at airports and airlines, air navigation service providers, makers of aircraft and engines and throughout the supply chain, our experts are working to make air travel even more efficient.”

“In Montreal this September, we would like to collaborate with your governments as well, to help support a global offsetting scheme for air transport and to provide a clear path for our sector’s climate future.”

Governments are currently negotiating the world’s first agreement on developing a global market mechanism for a single sector. Negotiators at a high level meeting in Montreal last week started converging on a proposal which would be presented at the upcoming ICAO Assembly in September this year.

Michael Gill, Executive Director of the cross-industry Air Transport Action Group noted that, whilst difficult negotiations remained on a couple of key areas: “the high level meeting has demonstrated that ICAO is the right place for these discussions. Delegations have been showing impressive efforts to consolidate the negotiating text and come to an agreement. We are encouraged by all parties’ willingness to engage pragmatically in the negotiations.”

Gill continued: “There are large parts of the new working text which the aviation industry can support and which will provide a solid basis for the world’s first global market mechanism. However, we are also eager to ensure that the scheme covers a high level of global air traffic and would encourage governments to have this in mind as the negotiations continue. The industry is ready to play its role and we further encourage governments to deliver a deal with concrete parameters that allows us to start implementation from 2020.”

The aviation industry has been a strong supporter of the process at ICAO, since it first proposed the measure in 2009. At the ATAG Global Sustainable Aviation Summit in September last year, 28 industry CEOs and Directors General, representing over 90% of the global aviation sector, sent governments an Open Letter encouraging a strong result at this year’s ICAO Assembly. On Tuesday this week, a Communique was issued from another ATAG event, encouraging progress at this weeks’ ICAO meeting.",air-traffic

"The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) today posted a large database showing the city, state and zip code of each registered drone owner. Release of the database responds to a number of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests submitted since the new unmanned aircraft registration system began operating on December 21, 2015.

The FAA is not posting the names and street addresses of registered owners because the data is exempt from disclosure under a FOIA exemption that protects information in agency files from a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.

The FAA based its determination to post only city, state and zip code on several factors, including, in part, that many of the registrants are minors and only hobbyists or recreational users.  In addition, when the FAA published its Federal Register notice pertaining to the new unmanned aircraft registration system it specifically advised the public that name and addresses would only be available by the registration number issued to the registrant. For these reasons, the FAA believes the privacy interest in such data outweighs any public interest.

Anyone who owns a drone weighing more than 0.55 lbs. but less than 55 lbs. must register before flying the aircraft outdoors for hobby or recreation. All owners of small unmanned aircraft used for other purposes must also register as one of the requirements associated with a Section 333 exemption.

"The aircraft was taking part in a flying display at Shoreham Airport during which it conducted a manoeuvre with both a vertical and rolling component, at the apex of which it was inverted. Following the subsequent descent, the aircraft did not achieve level flight before it struck the westbound carriageway of the A27. Eleven people on the ground were fatally injured. Special Bulletin S3/2015 was published on 4 September 2015 to provide preliminary information about the accident gathered from ground inspection, radar data, recorded images and other sources.



A further Special Bulletin, S4/2015, was published on 21 December 2015 to highlight findings of the AAIB investigation regarding ejection seat safety and the maintenance of ex-military jet aircraft, and to assist the Civil Aviation Authority in its ‘Review of UK Civil Air Displays’ (the CAA Review) announced on 9 September 2015. On 28 October 2015 the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) published Civil Aviation Publication (CAP) 1351 - ‘CAA Review of Civil Air Displays: progress report’, setting out the progress it had made in its review to date, and explaining the next steps it would be taking. 



On 26 January 2016 the CAA published CAP 1371 - ‘UK Civil Air Display Review: Actions that impact on UK civil air displays in 2016’. The AAIB investigation of the accident to G-BXFI is an independent process but it has and will continue to inform the CAA Review. The AAIB recognises that as well as being enjoyed by large numbers of spectators and participants, flying displays are also considered to provide important economic and educational benefits1 . 



The sole purpose of an AAIB investigation is to improve aviation safety by determining the causes of accidents and serious incidents to make Safety Recommendations intended to prevent recurrence. It does not therefore consider the balance between those benefits and improvements. This Special Bulletin considers public protection and safety management at flying displays. 



A final report will be published in due course. 



Fourteen Safety Recommendations are made and are listed below.



Safety Recommendation 2016-031 It is recommended that the Civil Aviation Authority review and publish guidance that is suitable and sufficient to enable the organisers of flying displays to manage the associated risks, including the conduct of risk assessments.



Safety Recommendation 2016-032 It is recommended that the Civil Aviation Authority specify the safety management and other competencies that the organiser of a flying display must demonstrate before obtaining a Permission under Article 162 of the Air Navigation Order.



Safety Recommendation 2016-033 It is recommended that the Civil Aviation Authority introduces a process to ensure that the organisers of flying displays have conducted suitable and sufficient risk assessments before a Permission to hold such a display is granted under Article 162 of the Air Navigation Order.



Safety Recommendation 2016-034 It is recommended that the Civil Aviation Authority specify the information that the commander of an aircraft intending to participate in a flying display must provide the organiser, including the sequence of manoeuvres and the ground area over which the pilot intends to perform them, and require that this be done in sufficient time to enable the organiser to conduct and document an effective risk assessment.

"A High Level Meeting being convened by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) on 11 May received executive-level support from the aviation industry today, as leaders representing all parts of the sector encouraged governments to progress their deliberations on a global carbon offsetting scheme for air transport.

The ICAO discussions have been gathering pace since the UN specialised aviation agency agreed to the development of an economic mechanism at its Assembly in 2013. The next such meeting, in September this year, will decide on the design of the scheme in which CO2 emissions growth from 2020 is offset through the international carbon markets, effectively capping the growth in international aviation emissions. It is seen as part of a basket of measures to tackle aviation’s CO2 emissions, alongside new technology, use of sustainable alternative fuel, improved operations and more efficient infrastructure.

At today’s Global Sustainable Aviation Forum, timed to support the intergovernmental talks, Executive Director of the cross-industry Air Transport Action Group (ATAG), Michael Gill, said: “We are now less than five months away from the crucial ICAO Assembly, at which industry hopes governments will agree to go ahead with the global offsetting scheme. We have come a long way and made impressive progress. But key negotiating points remain and we encourage our government colleagues to spend the next few days ironing out any remaining differences at the ICAO High Level Meeting.”

Following technical and political discussions, ICAO developed a proposal for a global offsetting scheme, which was presented to States in January. Consultations have taken place since then through regional education and outreach sessions. The High Level Meeting starting tomorrow is expected to make further progress, but sticking points such as differentiation between developing and developed economies remain.

Gill commented, “These discussions were never going to be easy – this is the first time any sector has attempted such a global mechanism. But the industry is fully behind the plan, as evidenced by an open letter sent to governments from 28 industry chief executives in September last year. We have followed that today with a Communiqué from the Global Sustainable Aviation Forum, outlining the industry’s thoughts on the process.”

The Communiqué is available at http://bit.ly/1WWXesZ and summarises interventions from the following aviation industry leaders:

ACI Director General, Angela Gittens, said, “The aviation industry is as one in our commitment to tackling climate change. Our goals, originally set out at ATAG’s 2008 Aviation and Environment Summit, are ambitious and a globally agreed set of offsetting rules is vital to our continued unified progress on CO2 emissions reduction. We applaud ICAO for the work it has done to date and look forward to the positive outcome of tomorrow’s High Level Meeting, marking a significant next step in aviation’s world-leading climate change activities.”

CANSO Director General, Jeff Poole, said, “As well as carbon offsetting, all parts of the industry have important roles to play in climate change actions. Improvements in air traffic management are helping to reduce emissions through measures such as performance-based navigation, air traffic flow management, shortening of routes and more flexible routings.”

IATA Director General and CEO, Tony Tyler said, “Airlines are determined to do the right thing in mitigating their climate change impact. And we are counting on the 191 member states of ICAO to enable that important result by reaching an agreement later this year on a global market based measure.”",air-traffic

Avinor's modernisation programme is on schedule, with a goal of annual savings of NOK 600 million from 2018. In 2017 the expansions of Bergen Airport and Oslo Airport will be completed. Air traffic at Avinor's airports increased by 2.7 per cent, while the operating result comprised NOK 71 million in Q1 2016, compared to NOK 143 million for the same period last year. Avinor's modernisation programme is on schedule, with a goal of annual savings of NOK 600 million from 2018. In 2017 the expansions of Bergen Airport and Oslo Airport will be completed. “We provide good and safe operations, our expansion projects are on schedule, and we are set to reach our cost-saving targets. We are very pleased with this. As in previous years, the first few months of the year have yielded a poor result. Aviation is linked to the overall economy, and this is evident from the industry's results,” says CEO Dag Falk-Petersen of Avinor. Air traffic through Avinor’s airports in the first quarter of 2016 increased by 2.7 per cent compared to the corresponding period last year. The increase is most pronounced in international traffic, while offshore helicopter traffic continues to decline. Avinor Air Navigation Services saw a reduction in income from overflights over Norway of 1.9 per cent in Q1. The Group’s operating income for the period was NOK 2,288 million, and the result after tax was NOK -2 million. The result after tax was reduced by NOK 39 million compared to the corresponding period last year as a consequence of reduced operating income, increased project costs carried over the income statement and increased depreciations. The group's underlying operating costs showed a decline of 4.9 per cent compared with the same period last year. In early 2015 Avinor decided to implement a extensive modernisation programme. For the 2015-2018 period a goal has been set of combined cost cuts amounting to NOK 1.5 billion, with NOK 600 million in cost savings per year from 2018. The programme's forecast for gains as of March 2016 is ahead of schedule.

"Between 16th and 25th of March 2016 at HungaroControl’s Centre of Research, Development and Simulation (CRDS), 39 Air Traffic Controllers and ATM experts from Croatia Control (CCL) and Serbia and Montenegro Air Traffic Services (SMATSA), supported by BHANSA (Bosnia and Herzegovina Air Navigation Services Agency,) successfully participated in the SEAFRA (South-East Axis Free Route Airspace) Real-Time Simulation.

The controllers arrived in Budapest in order to test different scenarios for the improvement of implementation of the cross-border free route planning concept. CCL and SMATSA, supported by BHANSA, are planning to introduce the SEAFRA Concept without time restrictions as of 8th of December 2016. Therefore the need for validation of its impact on airspace sector configuration, with special attention to operational and technological solutions was recognised.

A wide variety of impacts was assessed and evaluated during the SEAFRA RTS, with special attention to human factors such as situational awareness and workload, as well as safety matters, in order to enable future FRA operations in the area with no or tolerable impact on all parts of ATM systems of participating ANSPs.

This project is one of the key improvements in line with the EU initiative on establishing the Single European Sky regardless of state or even FAB borders, aiming to enhance safety and efficiency, and to increase capacity of air traffic in Europe. By following this initiative for implementing H24 FRA Concept SEAFRA, participating ANSPs responsible for ANS provision in four different states have a common goal to improve ATS safety and efficiency on one, and to protect the environment by reducing fuel, CO2 and fuel NOx emissions on the other hand.",air-traffic
"The results from the live trials at Paris (CDG) and Zurich airport are very promising in terms of reducing delays and flying time. Further trials will take place in April and be completed in September 2016. 



iStream is one of several large-scale demonstration activities co-funded by the SESAR Joint Undertaking (SESAR JU). It aims at demonstrating the benefits of Target Time for complete traffic flows, with comprehensive collaborative processes. It paves the way for better predictability of flights leading to smoother flight management and less arrival holding, while also preserving a high level of safety. This project is aligned with the SESAR deployment as mandated by the Pilot Common project (PCP). 



Live trials took place at Paris (CDG) from 13 April – 24 June 2015 and are still on-going at Zurich airport since 15 June 2015. Their results are very promising: dynamic Demand and Capacity Balancing (dDCB) in Paris-CDG airport : from April 13th to June 24th 2015, Air Traffic Flow and Capacity Management (ATFCM) scenarios and tactical ATC routings were performed on morning arrival peak in order to improve the North/South balancing. ATFCM delays were reduced by 36%, while handling a 5% traffic increase on the same period. 



Target Time management at Zurich airport: more than 2,000 commercial flights have already successfully tested this new ATFCM procedure. The adherence to Target Times allowed savings of flight time in TMA, and reduced holdings. Furthermore, each aircraft operator could exchange Target Times between its aircrafts at arrival for more flexibility in operations (“AFLEX”). 



The next iStream exercises will take place from April 2016: building on 2015 trials, dDCB will be used to reduce ATFCM delays at Paris-CDG, while improving the cooperation with neighboring ACC and airspace users, and Target Times will be used with the objective to improve the efficiency of ATCM measures while providing more arrival flexibility to airlines (“AFLEX”). Target Times will also be used in en-route control sectors of Reims UAC and Maastricht UAC, with objective to improve the efficiency of the Short Term ATFCM Measures (STAM) applied by the Flow Management Position in ACCs. 



All iStream live trials will be finished by the end of September 2016.

"The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is currently reviewing the report and recommendations of the Micro Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Aviation Rulemaking Committee. The agency had tasked the group to develop recommendations for performance-based regulations that would let certain unmanned aircraft operate over people not directly involved in the flight of the aircraft.

The rulemaking committee, which began meeting March 8, worked under a tight deadline of April 1 to deliver its report. The task force included a diverse set of aviation stakeholders, including UAS manufacturers, UAS operators, consensus standards organizations, researchers and academics.

“We commend the committee members for their sincere dedication and for producing a comprehensive report in such a short time,” said FAA Administrator Michael Huerta. “This type of collaborative government and industry partnership is exactly what is needed to keep pace with this rapidly changing industry and will serve as a model for future rulemaking advisory tasks.”

The ARC’s consensus report recommends establishing four small UAS categories, defined primarily by risk of injury to people below the flight path. For each category, the group recommends assigning a potential risk linked to either weight or impact energy. The report also addresses operational restrictions and standards to minimize the risks associated with each category.

The FAA will use the information in the report to develop a flexible, performance-based proposed rule. The public will have an opportunity to comment on the proposal based on the ARC’s recommendations.

"Aviation consultancy Helios has been engaged by the Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) to assess the operational and technical feasibility of implementing a remote tower solution to provide ATC services to a dual runway operation at Dublin airport.

Dublin airport has achieved significant traffic growth over the past few years and is considering meeting ongoing growth with the construction of a second parallel runway. Amongst the associated airport infrastructure that will be required for this runway is the deployment of a new Air Traffic Control tower.

The IAA was already granted planning permission for the development of a new 86.9m high tower in 2007. However, recent developments in the field of remote tower technology have raised the possibility for an alternative to the conventional tower, making this concept more viable for larger operations.

Helios will recommend whether to proceed with a new visual control tower, or to deploy a remote tower solution. As part of the study, Helios is considering all aspects of ATM including safety, human factors, regulatory approval, technical requirements and operations. Stakeholder workshops will be held with the main actors in Irish aviation to ensure a transparent decision-making process.

"Cambridge based radar technology company Aveillant today announced the sale of its Gamekeeper drone detection radar to provide security and privacy over Monaco. As part of a strategic partnership with JCPX Development, the system will be installed at a site in the principality later this year as the core element of JCPX’s comprehensive counter-UAV solution, which as well as the radar element includes high resolution cameras and radio jamming devices.

Aveillant CEO, David Crisp, said: “We’re very excited about this project. Unregulated use of drones is becoming an increasing worry for a wide variety of people and organisations. In Gamekeeper we have a technology that can protect a large area with high reliability. The built environment in Monaco is a challenging one for radar detection, meaning our unique Holographic Radar approach is very well suited to it.”

Jean-Christophe Drai, the Chairman of JCPX Development, added “With our counter UAV solution, JCPX will be the first company to provide a complete system to face the huge challenge of drone threats in a real urban environment. Our system is able to detect, identify, track and jam small UAVs to guarantee the safety of people and sensitive areas. Our strong partnership with Aveillant allowed us to build a tailored answer to our customer’s needs. The Monaco project is a world first in the civil application of this technology, and should pave the way for vastly improved security against small drones in the future.”

The Gamekeeper radar is designed to detect targets down to 0.01m2 cross section and has a range of up to 5km. Holographic Radar technology does not scan across an area as a traditional radar does, but continuously floodlights a volume of space, gathering 3D position and motion information from all targets, all of the time. This gives a detection and tracking capability beyond that possible with other radars.

"The International Federation of Air Traffic Controllers' Associations, IFATCA, is deeply concerned about the developments within Belgocontrol, the Belgian air traffic services provider, and the problems these have caused for the safe and efficient flow of air traffic in the region. 



This conflict again highlights the shortcomings within the Belgian air traffic control system. In a letter to the Belgian government in 2009, IFATCA highlighted the unacceptable and potentially unsafe working conditions and lacking involvement of staff representatives. Despite continued promises made by management, no measurable improvements can be seen - on the contrary.



Air traffic controllers are faced with unworkable rosters to account for the long lasting lack of recruitment and training of personnel. In all likelihood, these practises violate European rules on air traffic controller working conditions and fatigue management. Controllers have to cope with incessant, politically-driven procedure changes and are frequently confronted with technical outages. Their pension age is now set to well exceed the accepted norm for controllers working high-density airspace. On top of this already almost unbearable pressure, a slanderous campaign was launched against highly skilled professionals without any respect or consideration for their continued commitment that has helped the Belgian aviation system survive crisis upon crisis.



 Besides the local problems, there is also a European dimension to the conflict. Both in Belgium as elsewhere in Europe, air traffic control increasingly has to rely on the willingness of individuals to make the system work. If controllers, responsibly and in accordance with EU regulation, declare a ‘provisional inability’ to safely perform their duty, the system collapses, resulting in huge delays and painful situations for all involved stakeholders. 



Similar situations have been experienced in Spain, Poland, France and other European countries. Under pressure from the European Commission to minimize costs, service providers have significantly reduced or stopped investing in their staff and in modernization of technical equipment. While this may save money in the short term, this shortsightedness will in the long run create major problems to maintain a safe and efficient Air Traffic Management system.

IFATCA calls upon all European governments and the Commission to finally understand that the current approach of the Single European Sky undertaking puts the entire system at risk. To consider only cost saving without regard to safety and human factors is having dramatic and possibly irreversible effects throughout our industry. 



The modernization process of the Air Traffic Management system in Europe can only be achieved if the affected service providers and staff, in particular the air traffic controllers, are involved to find safe and sustainable solutions. Controllers are not part of the problem: they are an absolutely essential part of the solution!",air-traffic
"Micro Nav Limited, formed in 1988 and based in Bournemouth, has won a contract to extend the ATC Simulation system capacity for SMATSA Aviation Academy (SAA) which operates as part of Serbia and Montenegro Air Traffic Services (SMATSA) LLC. The requirement is to double the 2D and 3D Tower installation to create a second 180° Flat Panel Tower display, with an increased number of Controller and Pseudo Pilot positions.

Enabling Technology Award - Lockheed Martin: En Route Automation Modernisation (ERAM) 

In March 2015, Lockheed Martin reached a critical milestone in the FAA En Route Automation Modernization (ERAM) programme, after completing system deployment at all 20 En Route centres. ERAM replaces four legacy systems that were nearing the end of their maintainability. This critical technology (including more than two million lines of software code) enables the FAA to maintain safe separation of aircraft flying at or above 10,000 ft. 



The ERAM tracking function processes target reports from multiple surveillance sources (such as radar and ADS-B), replacing the single radar tracker. This provides more reliable tracking in areas with little or no radar coverage (such as the Gulf of Mexico). ERAM is also designed to improve flight plan processing. It creates a four-dimensional trajectory for each flight, from takeoff to landing, which aids controller situational awareness and decision-making.

Technology Award - Saab and LFV: First operational approved remote tower service in the world

Saab and Swedish ANSP LFV pioneered the development of remote tower technology for air traffic control. Their Remote Tower Services (RTS) programme passed a major landmark in April 2015 when Örnsköldsvik became the first airport in the world to operate with a remote tower 150 km away in Sundsvall. Remote sensor technology creates a 360° view of the airfield, exactly replicating the sights and sounds from a conventional control tower. A high bandwidth connection streams the data to a control suite equipped with Saab displays, electronic flight strips, and communications equipment. 



Saab supplied a second RTS system in late 2015 for Sundsvall-Timrå Airport, with Linköping Airport due to follow in 2016. Enhancements to RTS include the capability to operate multiple airports from a single controller working position, track labelling, overlays, and vehicle tracking.

Runway Award - EUROCONTROL, Heathrow Airport, Lockheed Martin, NATS: Time-Based Separation (TBS)

EUROCONTROL, Heathrow Airport, Lockheed Martin and NATS worked together on a Time Based Separation (TBS) project for aircraft arriving at the UK airport. To counteract the effect of wind on the landing rate and provide resilience for airport operations, TBS replaces distance separations with time separations. TBS uses live data from the aircraft to dynamically calculate the headwind effect on final approach, to determine the optimal safe wake vortex spacing between aircraft.  



Real-time separation indicators are provided to controllers to assist with managing final approach separations. Full use of TBS at Heathrow began in March 2015. TBS will be expanded by NATS and Lockheed Martin to incorporate the latest concept developments being validated in SESAR Project 6.8.1.

Special Achievement Award

This year a Special Achievement Award was given to EUROCONTROL for 20 years of central flow management (1995-2015). This optimises the efficient use of European airspace: a single management centre represents 41 European countries working together to balance demand and supply throughout the region’s upper airspace, to support safe and efficient air travel. 

Since EUROCONTROL created the Central Flow Management Unit in 1995, it has managed a 68 percent traffic increase and a network capacity increase of 112 percent. It has saved more than 280 million minutes in en route ATFM delays, saving airlines €20 billion.

"The FAA has released its annual Aerospace Forecast Report Fiscal Years 2016 to 2036 that finds a sustained increase in overall air travel and the use of Unmanned Aircraft Systems 

(UAS).

A key portion of the forecast focuses on projections for the growth in the use of unmanned aircraft, also known as drones. The FAA estimates small, hobbyist UAS purchases may grow from 1.9 million in 2016 to as many as 4.3 million by 2020.  Sales of UAS for commercial purposes are expected to grow from 600,000 in 2016 to 2.7 million by 2020.  Combined total hobbyist and commercial UAS sales are expected to rise from 2.5 million in 2016 to 7 million in 2020.

Predictions for small UAS used in the commercial fleet are more difficult to develop given the dynamic, quickly-evolving nature of the market. Both sales and fleet size estimates share certain broad assumptions about operating limitations for small UAS during the next five years: daytime operations, within visual line of sight, and a single pilot operating only one small UAS at a time.  The main difference in the high and low end of the forecasts is differing views on how those limitations will influence the widespread use of UAS for commercial purposes.

Looking at commercial air travel, Revenue Passenger Miles (RPMs) are considered the benchmark for measuring aviation growth.  An RPM is one revenue passenger traveling one mile. The FAA forecast calls for system RPMs by mainline and regional air carriers to grow at an average rate of 2.6 percent a year between 2016 and 2036, with international RPMs projected to increase 3.5 percent a year, doubling over the forecast period. Domestic RPMs are forecast to increase by more than 50 percent over the same time.  In 2015, system RPMs by U.S. carriers grew from 857 billion to 889 billion, a 3.8 percent increase.

The FAA’s NextGen program is helping to meet this consistent aviation growth. NextGen focuses on implementing technologies and procedures that utilize satellite-based aircraft navigation and phase out efficiency limitations of the current ground-based radar navigation system. For example, the environmental and economic gains of reduced fuel usage associated with NextGen advancements are projected to achieve a savings of billions of dollars in airline operational costs and achieve sustainable aviation growth.

Proven economic data that utilize sources such as generally accepted projections for the nation’s GDP are used in the FAA annual forecast, which has consistently made it the industry-wide standard of U.S. aviation-related activities. The report looks at all facets of air travel including commercial airlines, air cargo, private general aviation, and fleet sizes.",air-traffic
"The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) expects thousands of birds may be saved each year because of changes the agency has made to its communication tower lighting standards.

The FAA has developed a number of tower lighting configurations for tall structures to warn pilots they are approaching an obstruction, particularly during nighttime hours and in bad 

weather. The configurations include white and red steady-burning lights, flashing lights and strobe lights, as well as various combinations of the three types of lights. Over the past few years, wildlife biology research  has determined that migratory birds appear to be particularly attracted to non-flashing red tower lights. The research concluded the birds are drawn toward that type of light and become confused and exhausted or collide with the towers and their supporting guy wires, killing thousands of birds every year.

As a result of the research conclusions, wildlife organizations, the telecommunication industry, and the Federal Communication Commission collectively asked the FAA to consider changing its lighting standards to reduce migratory bird fatalities by developing configurations that feature flashing lights instead of steady-burning lights, or completely omit the steady-burning lights in some cases.



 After evaluating the proposal, the FAA conducted flight tests in northern Michigan to compare the traditional steady-burning lighting with a variety of different types of flashing lights. The results  showed that the new configurations that featured flashing lights provided acceptable warnings for pilots and were likely to result in a significant decrease in bird fatalities.

Based on that determination, the FAA updated its Advisory Circular (AC)  for obstruction marking and lighting in December 2015. New tower lighting schemes should now follow the revised guidance, and operators of towers with the old lighting system should submit plans explaining how and when they will transition to the new standards.",air-traffic
"Defence and security company Saab announces that it has been awarded a contract to deploy Wide Area Multilateration (WAM) surveillance systems around the cities of Cucuta and Medellin for Aeronáutica Civil de Colombia (Aerocivil).

Saab will be working with its local Colombian partner, Entelcom S.A.S., to install an array of its latest multilateration and ADS-B ground stations to provide surveillance of the Cucuta and Medellin approach sectors. ADS-B is the next generation of aircraft surveillance, which utilizes global navigation satellite systems to track aircraft positions. Saab’s system will improve the safety of flights operating in the visual corridor between Enrique Olaya Herrera Airport (SKMD) and José María Córdova International Airport (SKRG). Saab’s field-proven technology provides coverage in areas that are infeasible to reach with traditional radar.

“Saab’s multilateration and ADS-B solutions provide air navigation service providers like Aerocivil with the critical surveillance they need while costing much less than radar-based solutions” explains Anders Carp, Head of Saab Traffic Management.

Saab is the leading multilateration surveillance provider in the world and is responsible for more than half of all global installations. Saab provides the global defence and aviation markets with advanced sensor technologies, next-generation radars, ATC automation tools, and collaborative decision-making and efficiency solutions. It serves military, civil aviation, airport and airline customers in more than 40 countries across six continents.",air-traffic
"The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) today released an updated list of pilot, air traffic controller and citizen reports of possible encounters with unmanned aircraft systems (UAS). The latest report covers August 22, 2015 through January 31, 2016.

Reports of unmanned aircraft have increased dramatically since 2014. Safely integrating unmanned aircraft into the national airspace system is one of the FAA's top priorities, and the agency wants to send a clear message that operating drones around airplanes and helicopters is dangerous and illegal.

""We have a number of educational initiatives with our government and industry partners to teach drone operators how to fly safely, including the drone registry we launched last December,"" said FAA Administrator Michael Huerta. “But enforcement goes hand-in-hand with education, and we will take action against anyone who operates irresponsibly to the full extent of the law.”

The FAA wants operators to know where it's legal to fly their drone. More than 406,000 people have registered since the registry went live in late December.

For current information on where unmanned aircraft can be flown safely, the FAA offers the B4UFLY app that is available for iOS and Android smartphones. The app is free and can be downloaded from iTunes and Google Play. Unauthorized operators may be subject to stiff fines and criminal charges, including possible jail time.

After a comprehensive risk analysis, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has raised the unmanned aircraft (UAS) “blanket” altitude authorization for Section 333 exemption holders and government aircraft operators to 400 feet. Previously, the agency had put in place a nationwide Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA) for such flights up to 200 feet.

The new COA policy allows small unmanned aircraft -- operated as other than model aircraft (i.e. commercial use) -- to fly up to 400 feet anywhere in the country except restricted airspace and other areas, such as major cities, where the agency prohibits UAS operations.

“This is another milestone in our effort to change the traditional speed of government,” said FAA Administrator Michael Huerta. “Expanding the authorized airspace for these operations means government and industry can carry out unmanned aircraft missions more quickly and with less red tape.”

The FAA expects the move will reduce the workload for COA applications for industry UAS operators, government agencies and the FAA's Air Traffic Organization. The agency also estimates the move will lessen the need for individual COAs by 30 to 40 percent. Other provisions of an FAA authorization, such as registering the UAS and making sure pilots have the proper certification, still apply.

Under the blanket COA, the FAA will permit flights at or below 400 feet for UAS operators with a Section 333 exemption for aircraft weighing less than 55 pounds and for government UAS operations. Operators must fly under daytime Visual Flight Rules, keep the UAS within visual line of sight of the pilot and stay certain distances away from airports or heliports:",air-traffic
"Aiming to provide customers the best possible service, and meet the targets of EU’s Single European Sky programme, Avinor now decided to invest in an upgrade of its existing ATM system, and enter the iTEC alliance in collaboration with NATS

An upgraded ATM-system for its en-route and approach services is of key importance for Avinor Air Navigation Services (Avinor). Avinor’s existing technical platform was developed in the early 1990’s and, as with many European ATM systems, needs to be developed to meet future requirements.

- This investment decision is an important milestone for Avinor. With this investment, we will have an upgraded system which will enable us to deliver on the targets SESAR and the Single European Sky programme, at a lowest possible cost and complexity. This will enable us to provide the best possible services to our customers, while maintaining our attractive unit rate, says Jan-Gunnar Pedersen, Director of En-route services at Avinor.



Following an extensive evaluation of commercial and technological options, Avinor aims to develop its existing technology from INDRA by entering the iTEC alliance in collaboration with NATS. By entering the iTEC alliance, Avinor becomes part of part of Europe’s largest ATM system collaboration along with ANSPs in Spain (ENAIRE), Germany (DFS), the UK (NATS) and the Netherlands (LVNL) – alongside systems provider Indra. Lithuania (Oro Navigacija), Poland (PANSA) also intend to enter the alliance.

Members of the iTEC alliance gain several benefits through collaboration, including reduced operational expenditure through common software and shared development costs; methods developed on common system that can easily be shared; increased safety through shared methods and processes; increased interoperability through common flight data processing and open interfaces; a common working position allowing easier communication among controllers; and reduction of risks through shared development, all of which ultimately help ANSPs to deliver the objectives of the Single European Sky.

Avinor is responsible for the 46 state-owned airports and air navigation services for civilian and military aviation in Norway. This network links Norway together - and links Norway to the world.

Avinor is a driving force in environmental work in aviation and a driving force to reduce the combined greenhouse gas emissions from Norwegian aviation. The company has a leading role in the work on developing and delivering biofuel for aircraft. Every year Avinor contributes to safe and efficient travel for around 50 million airline passengers. Around half travel to and from Oslo Airport.

More than 3,000 employees are responsible for planning, developing and operating airports and air navigation services. Avinor is funded by aviation fees and commercial sales at the airports.",air-traffic

"The International Air Transport Association (IATA) released a study projecting a one million job and EUR245 billion boost to European prosperity in 2035 from airspace modernization.

Europe is well-served by air connectivity, which today supports 11.7 million European jobs and $860 billion of European GDP. But it is inefficient. Average flights are nearly 50 kilometers longer than they need to be in terms of distance traveled and delays average around 10 minutes per flight. This inefficiency negatively impacts prosperity, productivity and sustainability. An IATA-commissioned study by SEO Economic Research estimated that these inefficiencies, if unchecked, will grow to cost the European economy EUR 245 billion in 2035.

""Air traffic management inefficiency is not just a burden for airlines. Travelers suffer wasted time from delays. The environment suffers from avoidable emissions. And businesses face reduced productivity. Combined, all of this has a cost on Europe’s competitiveness. And the cost is shared broadly. This study shows that every European—individual or business—has a stake in this issue,"" said Tony Tyler, IATA’s Director General and CEO.

Europe has long had a plan to improve its air traffic management—the Single European Sky (SES) project—which aims to deliver a threefold increase in capacity, improve safety by a factor of 10, reduce environmental impact by 10%, and cut costs by 50%.

""Europe has failed in achieving the SES goals. Despite a strong European Commission vision and push for SES, national interests have prevailed. The incentive to improve efficiency is to make Europe more prosperous with the realization of EUR 245 billion and one million jobs in 2035. The launch of this study is a call to action across the spectrum of business and individual interests in Europe to help deliver a stronger, more connected economy,"" said Tyler.

A fully modernized and reformed airspace in 2035 (compared to a ""do nothing"" scenario in which the status quo prevails) will generate tangible benefits to European tourism, trade and the knowledge economy. Examples of incremental and indicative improvements include:

""Predicting the future is always fraught with uncertainty. But the starting point already shows a clear gap. The US has one provider to manage its airspace and Europe has 38 providers to manage a similarly complex air transport sector. And if nothing is done, the problem will only get worse,"" said Tyler.

The release of the study marks the launch of a Europe-wide campaign. IATA will be calling on consumer groups and business associations to recognize the broad importance of efficient air connectivity to the economy, productivity and quality of life at the national level. ""Quantifying the value of what we are aiming for in jobs and GDP should be a great motivator in aligning national policies and action with a vision for an efficiently-connected and competitive Europe. EUR 245 billion is a worthy goal!"" said Tyler.",air-traffic

 KLM Royal Dutch Airlines today launched a series of around 80 biofuel flights from Oslo to Amsterdam operated with an EMBRAER 190. The flights are marking yet another step in the right direction towards phasing in jet biofuel in the aviation industry. The flights will depart from Avinor’s Oslo Airport, the first international airport hub in the world to supply biofuel directly from its hydrant system since January this year. For these specific flights, operated by KLM Cityhopper, sustainable jet fuel is delivered into wing by separate fuel trucks. This way, Embraer can conduct measurements to gauge the efficiency of sustainable jet fuel compared to fossil jet fuel. The sustainable jet fuel is produced by Neste within the ITAKA* project (funded by the European Commission) and made available by Air BP and SkyNRG in close cooperation with Norwegian airport operator Avinor. The fuel is produced from RSB certified Camelina oil and in full compliance with the EU Renewable Energy Directive (RED). The flights are partly funded by the partners in the KLM Corporate BioFuel Programme. Jon Sjølander, Vice President Strategy Avinor: “Reducing carbon emissions from the aviation industry requires cooperation and coordination between several partners. Avinor has made a long-term commitment to make sustainable jet fuel available for airlines refueling at our airports. I am very pleased that KLM, one of the pioneers in development of sustainable jet fuel, has chosen Avinor’s Oslo Airport for these flights.” Boet Kreiken, Managing Director KLM Cityhopper: “KLM believes that sustainable biofuel is important for the airline industry. For this reason, we have for some time been cooperating with different partners, including those united within the scope of the KLM Corporate BioFuel Programme, to stimulate the development of the market. Our new cooperative relationship with Embraer and Avinor serves to underscore just how important this is.” Jorge Ramos, president of Embraer, Europe: “Embraer has been directly involved in several initiatives and partnerships for research and development of biofuels for aviation, but these flights with KLM are a flagship, as they represent the first initiative Embraer develops with aviation biofuels on regular flights. We will use the biofuel flights from Oslo to Amsterdam operated by the E190 to gather data to assess the performance of the engines using a percentage of jet biofuel in comparison with fossil-based kerosene.” Maarten van Dijk, CEO SkyNRG: “For the coming years, the price gap between sustainable and fossil jet fuel remains the biggest challenge to create a stable market for sustainable jet fuel. Therefore, engagement of all stakeholders, including governments, fuel producers and suppliers, airports and airlines is crucial. We’re proud to collaborate with KLM, Embraer, ITAKA, the partners in the KLM Corporate BioFuel Programme, Air BP and Avinor in supplying sustainable jet fuel for these flights.” Avinor is responsible for the 46 state-owned airports and air navigation services for civilian and military aviation in Norway.

"The UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has today announced the outcome of its consultation on charges for air displays. The regulator has reaffirmed its commitment to the air show industry and highlighted the importance of new safety enhancements being introduced. The CAA is not funded by the tax payer and therefore these charges must be met by the industry. However, the CAA has recognised the possible and immediate impact these increased charges could have on air show organisers and has therefore implemented a phased introduction of the new fees over the next three years.

An extensive review of air show safety has been carried out by the CAA, following the tragic accident at the Shoreham Air Show in August 2015. As part of the review a series of additional safety measures have been introduced that air shows must now meet in order to go ahead, including carrying out enhanced risk assessments. Tougher checks and training requirements for pilots and display directors are also being introduced.

The CAA launched a consultation in February on the proposed increases to fees to fund its air show work. This also recognised the historic under-recovery of costs for our regulatory oversight of air displays, although these increases do not seek to recover any historic under-recovery.

While needing to ensure that the new charges are in place, to enable us to introduce these important new safety measures this year, we recognise it may be difficult for some air shows to absorb these additional charges in 2016/17.



Therefore, to reduce the impact on the air display community, the CAA has decided to phase in the introduction of the new air display post event charges. The 2016/17 charges will now be set to recover £100,000 of the expected £200,000 of additional costs, with the remaining £100,000 being absorbed by the CAA.

Andrew Haines, CEO of the CAA, said, “We understand that people care passionately about air shows and we want all events to be a success. We are also very clear that we will not compromise on safety. Enhancing the safety of air shows is essential and this extra work must be funded.



“However, we have listened to the responses and recognise that some shows could face challenges in absorbing the full cost of these changes into this display season.

"Once again passengers and European airlines are being seriously affected by strike action by air traffic controllers(ATC)  in France. The Association of European Airlines (AEA) strongly condemns this unjustified industrial action which holds the entire industry to ransom. In the last twelve months there have been 9 days of ATC strikes in France. Once again the action is in protest against increasing efficiencies and decreasing costs in ATC provision.

Since Sunday morning, air passengers and airlines have been the victim of a French air traffic control strike that has a serious impact on flights to and from France but also on aircraft that have to fly through French airspace (overflights). Many airlines were forced to cancel flights and those flights that do operate encounter severe delays. The consequences of these strikes are felt by passengers, airlines, freight forwarders and express courier services, depriving Europe of much-needed connectivity and economic activity. Not to mention the environmental impact of increased CO2 from detours around the affected area.

The Association of European Airlines (AEA)  strongly condemns this intolerable situation. “This has to stop immediately”, says AEA’s CEO Athar Husain Khan. “Europe’s airlines and passengers have suffered at the hands of ATC providers, who enjoy a monopoly status, for years now. We urge the French government and the European Commission to take urgent action to ensure that airlines can continue to operate and passengers are not inconvenienced.”",air-traffic
"Experts from air navigation service providers of FABEC have investigated different ways to improve the vertical flight efficiency (VFE) of air traffic in European airspace. The investigation focused on the improved adaptation of vertical restrictions to seasonal and time-based procedures. It resulted in the improvement of 30 city pairs where aircraft are granted a more optimal vertical flight profile. City pairs are defined routes between major airports. Depending on the individual city pair, aircraft can fly on a defined higher flight level or on the flight level they request. Implementations have been being phased in since 2015. The improvements are beneficial for the environment in terms of fuel burn and CO2 emissions.",air-traffic
"The ASR-NG system (Airport Surveillance Radar - Next Generation) newly developed by Airbus Defence and Space has displayed globally unique detection capabilities for air traffic control radars in a series of flight tests and calibration measurements.

“Our new ASR-NG has provided proof of its excellent performance,” said Thomas Müller, Head of Electronics and Border Security (EBS) at Airbus Defence and Space. As a result, air traffic control can become more efficient, and consequently safer, despite a rapid increase in the volume of air traffic, including extremely small and non-cooperative aircraft, and despite challenges caused by wind energy plants.

In a two-day flight campaign at the EBS test facilities in Germany, the ASR-NG detected the Flight Calibration Services’ test aircraft of the type “Learjet” reliably in different scenarios. In particular, the radar system achieved excellent detection values when it came to small objects such as the Learjet at an extraordinarily great distance of 120 NM (approx. 220 km) and up to its maximum flight altitude of 45,000 ft (approx. 15 km). The ASR-NG was capable of this unique performance not only as a purely primary radar system, but also in conjunction with the secondary radar MSSR 2000 I (MSSR = Monopulse Secondary Surveillance Radar) in the so-called “full enhanced surveillance” mode in line with the new Mode S standard, which provides much more exact data on aircraft in a certain surveillance sector than previously. At the same time, the new signal processing algorithms and multiple parallel processing of the echoes received make it possible to suppress false echoes caused by wind turbines and to obtain a 3D altitude reading of the aircraft based on primary radar. The MSSR 2000 I is already being used in the air traffic control system of the German Armed Forces in a network working automatically (Mode S cluster).

Airbus DS Electronics and Border Security supplies air traffic control and identification systems in the military and civilian sector worldwide. Amongst others, the company equips the German Armed Forces’ airports with the ASR-S (Airport Surveillance Radar, S-Band) airport surveillance radar and delivers a complete approach control system to Switzerland. In addition, the MSSR 2000I secondary radar is deployed by the naval forces of Germany, France, Norway and Finland for military friend-or-foe identification. For civil and military air traffic control, those identification systems are used, for example, in Germany, France, USA, UK, Bulgaria or the Philippines.

EBS is a world leading provider of premium electronics in the areas of protection, surveillance and situational awareness. As a separate organizational unit within Airbus Defence and Space, it is managed according to arms-length principles serving the defence and security markets.

"Defence and security company Saab has announced that Austro Control, the Austrian Air Navigation Service Provider, has formally signed the final acceptance for its nation-wide Wide Area Multilateration (WAM) system.

Saab’s WAM system provides terminal and en route surveillance for all of Austria, covering six Terminal Maneuvering Areas, the entire Austrian FIR, and an additional zone of 40NM of high density airspace. Austro Control is using the WAM system to complement their existing Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR) infrastructure, to enable some SSR infrastructure to be retired, and to add surveillance of areas not previously covered by SSR due to the region's mountainous terrain.

The initial WAM contract was signed in 2011 and installation was completed in early 2013. Since then, tiers of airspace have incrementally gone operational with coverage today spanning the country’s entire upper airspace and down to ground level in the Salzburg TMA. Five additional TMAs will go operational this year.

”Nation-wide WAM projects like Austria present a multitude of integration challenges, which is where we excel. It’s not enough to have great technology, you need to be committed to making it work for your customers”, says Anders Carp head of Saab business unit Traffic Management.

”Our nation-wide WAM project is an excellent solution in terms of surveillance as well as business performance. Saab was committed to making sure the system met our needs and high standards. With endurance and solution orientation we were able to meet the challenge of successfully integrating WAM with the other elements of our surveillance chain. Austro Control has invested a lot but we are proud of the result”, says Werner Langhans, Director Engineering Services at Austro Control.

Saab’s multilateration solutions use multiple low-maintenance, non-rotating sensors to triangulate aircraft locations based on transponder signals to provide air traffic controllers with precise aircraft position and identification information regardless of weather conditions. With a higher update rate and greater positional accuracy than traditional radar, Saab’s multilateration provides effective surveillance for increased safety, capacity and efficiency of airspace. By employing advanced processing techniques, Saab uses the minimal number of sensors for a less complex, lower lifecycle cost solution. Additionally, each multilateration sensor deployed supports ADS-B, providing an infrastructure that is ready for today's surveillance needs and tomorrow's avionics.",air-traffic

"Indra has been awarded a contract to install one of its primary radars in South Korea to reinforce security and cover the surveillance of the busiest air traffic corridor in the world in terms of number of passengers: the route between Jeju and Seoul.

In 2013, the company was awarded a contract to install one of its Mode S secondary radars in the vicinity of Jeju airport. This is a system with state-of-the-art technology for identifying aircraft and obtaining data on their height and flying speed. Now the company is reinforcing this site with the installation of a new primary radar that detects the position of any aircraft, whether or not it actively identifies itself.

Indra thus enhances the surveillance of this route which, according to data from the International Air Transport Association (IATA), recorded the largest number of passengers worldwide in 2014. Specifically, 10.5 million passengers used the route, up 10.9% from the previous year.

Indra was awarded the contract after winning the open tender against some of the leading systems suppliers in the world, in consortium with local companies. With this new award, Indra reinforces its already solid position in South Korea.

"In February of 2016, NTT DATA Corporation was contracted by Cambodia Air Traffic Services Co. Ltd., a Cambodian air traffic control service provider, to carry out the installation and subsequent support of the flight path design system “PANADES®”.

In this project, NTT DATA will transfer one license from the “PANADES” that was installed in Vietnam to Cambodia, accompanying the conclusion of the “Project for the Capacity Development for Transition to the New CNS/ATM Systems in Cambodia, Lao PDR and Vietnam”, a Technical Cooperation Project1 with the Japan International Cooperation Agency.

This marks the sixth overseas introduction of “PANADES”, following introductions in Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, Laos, and Myanmar.

In recent years, aiming to improve the efficiency and safety of airplane operations and expand airspace capacity centered on Southeast Asian countries such as three of the countries in the Greater Mekong Subregion (Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia), JICA has been carrying out activities such as development support for capabilities related to the establishment of flight rules for performance-based navigation (PBN) and preparation support for next-generation airport security system training programs aimed at air traffic controllers and control technicians. In 2011, NTT DATA’s “PANADES” was adopted as a system to develop capabilities concerning the design of flight rules for performance-based navigation (PBN) in the “Project for the Capacity Development for Transition to the New CNS/ATM Systems in Cambodia, Lao PDR and Vietnam”. “PANADES” has come to be jointly utilized in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.2 Meanwhile, in Cambodia, there was an average growth of 11% in the number of airplanes between 2011 and 2015, and it is predicted that the flow of transportation will continue to increase in the future. Given this situation, on this occasion, accompanying the conclusion of JICA’s “Project for the Capacity Development for Transition to the New CNS/ATM Systems in Cambodia, Lao PDR and Vietnam”, it was decided that one of the “PANADES” licenses installed in Vietnam would be transferred to Cambodia. NTT DATA has been contracted by CATS, a Cambodian air traffic control service provider, to carry out the installation and subsequent support for “PANADES” on the occasion of the transfer.

“PANADES” is a system with the purpose of designing the routes flown by airplanes based upon international standards. In the design of flight paths, upon considering factors such as airplanes’ capabilities and the terrain, manmade obstacles, and climate conditions for each location to be designed, it is necessary to accurately carry out minute calculations, such as various parameter calculations and complex geometrical calculations in line with airplanes’ characteristics. PANADES is outfitted with the functionality to automatically process many of the complex calculations in such flight path design operations, and it has the merit of making it possible to automatically create flight zones with the input of as few parameters as possible. Due to this feature of PANADES, it is possible to aim for the shortening of the working time for the design of flight paths, the securing of the quality and reliability of design results, and the improvement of flight path safety.",air-traffic

"Joint initiative will bring data link communications to the 21st century, resulting in optimised airspace and airport capacity, plus reduction in flight times, aircraft fuel burn and CO2 emissions

Consortium of over 30 leading aviation and space companies have joined the project, including Airbus, Boeing, NATS, Thales Alenia Space, and the Iris programme’s first airline partner, Alitalia.

Inmarsat, the world’s leading provider of global mobile satellite communications, has been awarded a contract by the European Space Agency (ESA) to enhance Air Traffic Management (ATM) in Europe with a new generation of satellite-based data link communications.

Under the Iris Service Evolution programme, Inmarsat will head-up a consortium of over 30 leading companies from across the aviation industry to develop a technical, commercial and operational roadmap that meets Europe’s long-term requirements for enhanced air traffic communications.

The programme will focus on using advanced satellite technology to improve aeronautical data link services, enabling flight plans to be updated continuously, even while aircraft are on route to their destination. This will lead to the significant optimisation of European airspace and airport capacity, in addition to overall reductions in flight times, fuel burn and CO2 emissions.

Iris Service Evolution supports the Single European Skies ATM Research (SESAR) masterplan for the next-generation of air traffic management, which offers a high-level view of the critical developments that are required to deliver a high-performing aviation system for Europe.

Leo Mondale, President of Inmarsat Aviation, said: “Air traffic management is under great pressure and there is no doubt that the digitalisation of cockpit communication is a vital building block of the future, opening the door for airlines to truly benefit from enhanced data utilisation"".

“Iris will mark a new era of communication in the aviation industry and places Europe at the forefront of ATM innovation. Inmarsat pioneered satellite data link services in oceanic areas 25 years ago and we look forward to now bringing this expertise and knowledge to continental airspace. Together with ESA and members of the Iris consortium, we will demonstrate the important contribution that Iris will make to air traffic management in Europe.”

Iris Service Evolution builds on the Iris Precursor contract awarded to Inmarsat by ESA in November 2014, under which an initial set of services was developed to complement existing, but congested terrestrial data link services. The services, which address the aviation industry’s short-to-medium term ATM needs, are supported by Inmarsat’s next-generation SwiftBroadband Safety (SB-S) satcom system, an evolution of its existing high-capacity L-band SwiftBroadband system.

Iris Precursor achieved a milestone on 23rd February 2016, when the first test flight was operated between Toulouse and the Baleares Islands, passing above Madrid. The two-hour-and-40-minute flight, operated using an Airbus A330 aircraft, successfully performed initial 4D (i4D) flight path control and Controller Pilot Data Link Communication (CPDLC) exchanges with Maastricht Upper Area Control Centre (MUAC). It also tested the handover between Inmarsat satellite spot beams.

Iris Precursor is expected to support CPDLC and i4D flight path control by 2018, with the exchange of information coming directly from avionic systems. In the longer term, Iris will evolve to support Full 4D and operate in a highly secure multi-link environment with future terrestrial data links, enabling more efficient traffic management by synchronising trajectories between air and ground.

Magali Vaissiere, Director of Telecommunications and Integrated Applications at the European Space Agency (ESA), said: “Iris brings safer air traffic management to airlines and their passengers. It is an outstanding example of how cooperation between commercial partners and institutions can create effective technical solutions that improve our everyday lives and make European companies more competitive in the world markets.”

The Iris Service Evolution consortium gathers key players from air traffic management, air transport, aeronautics and the satcom industry, including Airbus, Boeing, NATS and Thales Alenia Space, together with the Iris programme’s first airline partner, Alitalia, the national carrier of Italy.

Giancarlo Schisano, Chief Operations Officer at Alitalia, said: “We are very proud of being the only current airline partner of the Iris consortium. We will make our know-how available for this key project, which will revolutionise the aviation industry. We believe that satellite communications represent the natural development of the industry and will lead to concrete benefits to airlines and their travellers due to reduced flight times, more savings on fuel consumption and an even more advanced flight safety.”

The ESA-Inmarsat collaboration was created following a major funding commitment approved at ESA’s 2012 Ministerial Council. While the programme will initially focus on Europe, the services will also benefit ATM operations in North America, Asia Pacific and other regions around the world where the growth of air traffic is placing a strain on ground-based networks.",air-traffic
"Snowflake Software today announced the worldwide launch of Laminar Data, the first industry specific cloud platform for managing, sharing and monetising aeronautical, weather and flight data.

Continuing to build on its innovative technology and its award-winning software products as a foundation for the platform, Laminar Data enables organisations to build operational applications and share operational data at a fraction of the cost previously possible.

Alexis James Brooker, Director of Professional Services, at Snowflake comments “Our vision for Laminar Data is to make data available and remove the management overhead of keeping it up to date. We want our customers to focus on using their operational knowledge to build ground breaking Apps rather than getting distracted with sourcing data and managing it.”

Laminar Data provides both a Data as a Service offering called the ‘Laminar Data Hub’ and a private Platform as a Service (PaaS) offering called the ‘Laminar Data Private Cloud’.

Application Developers need to acquire and manage complex aeronautical, weather and flight data to build applications. However, up to 80% of application development costs can be attributed to sourcing and reliably managing data. The Laminar Data Hub provides App Developers with a cloud platform pre-populated with leading sources of flight, weather and aeronautical data all delivered through developer-friendly APIs supported and managed by Snowflake in the cloud.

Data Providers such as Airports, ANSPs and Airlines have valuable data locked up in operational systems. An inability to share data hinders these organisations from solving critical operational problems. The Laminar Data Private Cloud enables Data Providers to selectively and securely share their data through developer-friendly APIs on a dedicated private platform supported and managed by Snowflake.

Ian Painter, Managing Director, at Snowflake comments “Laminar Data is a first in the marketplace. Too many operational problems remain unsolved because data is locked up or too complex to manage. Our aim with Laminar Data is to commoditise the acquisition, cost and complexity of working and sharing operational data, enabling organisations to build apps and share data at a fraction of the cost and time they can do today.”

Ana María Pastor Julián, Spain's Minister of Transport and Public Works, opened the Conference of World ATM Congress this morning. The Spanish government has been honoured to host the event over the last four years. Spain's ENAIRE is among the most modern air navigation service providers in the world, and safely and securely handled 11.9 percent of Europe's air traffic last year. Advances in air traffic management systems and efficiencies saved 3.5 million nautical miles of flight and reduced delays by 79 percent from 2011-2015. She highlighted the important role ENAIRE plays in SESAR and its deployment phase. ENAIRE is also developing the Common Iberian Airspace with Portugal to introduce even greater efficiencies. In recognition of International Women's Day, she closed by praising the role of women as pioneers in aviation.





The conference then examined the issues that most need to be addressed by today's top aviation leaders, including airspace capacity, aviation noise, and improving efficiency, and explored emerging technology, like remote towers, that impact the provision of air traffic services at airports. On Wednesday the conference will debate the implications of the safe and efficient introduction of new entrants into airspace, such as balloons, commercial space vehicles, and remotely piloted aircraft systems.

"Today, the SESAR Deployment Manager (SDM) and the European Organisation for Civil Aviation Equipment (EUROCAE) signed a Memorandum of Cooperation. 



The MoC provides the principles and sets a framework for efficient cooperation and communication between the SDM and EUROCAE with regard to SESAR deployment, in light of Regulation 409/2013. 



It is essential that EUROCAE and the SDM are closely coordinating and exchanging information on the standards development process and progress of relevant activities within EUROCAE on the one hand, but also for the SDM to provide information to EUROCAE on relevant developments regarding the deployment programme that could impact the standardisation activities. The MoC coordination is complementary to the coordination that will also take place in the European ATM Standardisation Coordination Group (EASCG) and the results will be reflected in the EASCG Rolling Plan. 



Standards development and EUROCAE activities are specifically recognised in this Regulation as an essential element in support of SESAR deployment. EUROCAE plays a key role on the European scene for the development of standards for Aviation, including Air Traffic Management. Through this cooperation, the SDM and EUROCAE will contribute to the provision of the required standards for a successful deployment of SESAR. 



Massimo Garbini, Managing Director SESAR Deployment Manager: “This formalization of the continuous dialogue between the SDM and EUROCAE will help reduce significantly the risk of non-timely availability or lack of necessary standards, we are very happy to officially welcome EUROCAE into SESAR Deployment today” 



Christian Schleifer, Secretary General EUROCAE “EUROCAE provide the essential bridge between research and development to deployment by offering a platform for voluntary experts to develop technical standards. The MoC is a significant milestone for EUROCAE to ensure consistent and efficient development of standards thanks to close coordination with the SDM.”",air-traffic
"Today the Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) announced that it is expanding its established and proven ASSET® platform  to include electronic Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) as part of its goal to automate the NOTAM origination and publication process.

Phase III of the ASSET platform calls for the design, creation, delivery, testing and implementation of a NOTAM module integrated into ASSET® within a year.  This intimidating deadline leaves Mr. Glyn Owen, Chief Operating Officer (COO), CGH Technologies unfazed.

“Using Agile software development and the proven ASSET® platform, plus the fact that we’ve done this before, makes this a low-risk alternative as compared to the more traditional software approaches others use.”  For example, IAA’s Drone Registry was created on the ASSET® platform by CGH in about 6 weeks and became operational across the Internet on 20 December 2015.

“Using the IAA authoritative source for NOTAM delivery mitigates many data challenges for issuing accurate NOTAMS,” said Mr. Philip Hughes, IAA’s Director of Commercial Technology and Training.  “Our approach will be transparent to any registered user of ASSET® and our NOTAM search program will reside on ASSET® available on our IAA website,” he continued.

“The key is that this will be published via the Cloud,” said Mr. Owen, undaunted by the task ahead.  “We are here to launch the next step for ATM Data Origination and we are excited to introduce the next generation of asset.”",air-traffic
"The FAIR STREAM project was the winner in the « Best Demonstration Project » category of the SESAR Project Awards at the World ATM Congress in Madrid on 8 March 2016.

The members of the FAIR STREAM consortium led by DSNA include 3 ANSP members of FABEC (DSNA, DFS, skyguide), 3 European airlines (Air France, SWISS, Lufthansa) and Airbus Prosky, Airbus’ ATM subsidiary. Other partners have been associated: Hop!, Delta and Boeing. Eurocontrol has also supported FAIR STREAM live trials.

This project demonstrated the feasibility of a new time-based operational procedure, known as “Target Time of Arrival (TTA)”, in situations where the arrival sector is saturated and needs to be regulated.

FAIR STREAM conducted demonstrations and flight trials at 3 airports located in the core area: Paris-CDG arrivals, Zurich arrivals and Munich arrivals. With Calculated Take-Off Time (CTOT), the aircraft has a time constraint for its take-off but the real constraint in saturated airspace is not taken into account in the management of the flight. In cruise, it may accelerate to make up lost time. But the arrival sector being congested, aircraft may have to stack in holding patterns before landing. Finally, the aircraft with CTOT may even land at the airport later than the aircraft with a TTA whose flight management was smoother. With TTA being used by all stakeholders, the effectiveness of network solutions to saturated airspace should be improved. FAIR STREAM demonstrated that flight crews with the existing on-board equipment could respect a TTA much better than during current operations. They can leave the gate earlier and fly more « fuel efficiently ». Moreover, ATCO and flight crew workload was not impacted. This concept can also be seen as a first step towards the initial 4D trajectory management concept.

Today, a new project, iStream (integrated SESAR Trials for Enhanced Arrival Management), aims at demonstrating the benefits of the TTA for complete traffic flows and the integration with an AMAN tool.

Maurice Georges, DSNA CEO, said : ""This award is in recognition of the promising results of this project, that paves the way for better predictability of flights leading to smoother flight management and less arrival holding, while also preserving a high level of safety.""

"Air navigation service providers AVINOR (Norway), Oro Navigacija (Lithuania) and PANSA (Poland) today all announced their intent to join the European iTEC alliance during the World ATM Congress in Madrid.

The three air navigation service providers signed Letters of Intent, setting out their plan to join the air navigation service providers of Spain (ENAIRE), Germany (DFS), the UK (NATS) and the Netherlands (LVNL) – alongside systems provider Indra – as part of Europe’s largest ATM system collaboration.

AVINOR will join the alliance through a Systems Group Agreement with NATS, while PANSA and Oro Navigacija intend to join through a Systems Group Agreement with DFS.

The joint creation of a common flight data processing system for use in different European countries is a major step towards the creation of a single, efficiently structured European airspace. iTEC enables 4D trajectory-based operations, featuring conflict detection, flight path monitoring and stripless operation, fully aligned with SESAR principles.

The existing Members of iTEC already account for more than a third of Europe’s air traffic. The addition of AVINOR, PANSA and Oro Navigacija will extend the benefits of iTEC to even more users of European airspace.

Robert Schickling, COO of DFS and Chairman of the iTEC Board, said: “The goal of the collaboration is to develop a high-end air traffic management system scalable up to very busy and complex airspace that meets SESAR requirements and enables significant steps forward in productivity. iTEC’s achievements provide a platform for synergies and thus cost reductions, helping to realise the vision of a Single European Sky (SES) with greater efficiencies and service standards for Europe’s airspace users. The intention of AVINOR, Oro Navigacija and PANSA to join the alliance is a success and clearly shows that iTEC is on the right way”.

AVINOR Managing Director of Air Navigation Services, Anders Kirsebom, said: “For us, it is vital to transition to an upgraded and interoperable system which enables us to build on the results of SESAR in order to achieve the goals of the Single European Sky programme, at a lowest possible cost, risk and complexity. Entering the iTEC alliance in close cooperation with NATS will enable us to provide the best possible services to our customers while maintaining our attractive unit rate”.

Algimantas Raščius, Director General of Oro Navigacija, said: “The iTEC collaboration approach that seeks economies of scale and realistic projects by developing state-of-the-art ATM technology is well known. The decision to join the iTEC alliance was part of the Baltic FAB strategy. We believe that entering the iTEC alliance through the DFS System Group is the most effective way to enhance Oro Navigacija's efficiency and bring benefits to our customers"".

PANSA Acting President, Magdalena Jaworska said: “For PANSA, the application to the iTEC collaboration has always been a natural evolution. We are glad to take steps that reinforce our development through the multi-ANSP collaboration, bringing our own contribution to the common solutions”.

New members of the iTEC alliance gain several benefits through collaboration, including reduced operational expenditure through common software and shared development costs; methods developed on common system that can easily be shared; increased safety through shared methods and processes; increased interoperability through common flight data processing and open interfaces; a common working position allowing easier communication among controllers; and reduction of risks through shared development, all of which ultimately help ANSPs to deliver the objectives of the Single European Sky.

"Indra has won a contract to deploy a radar station at Pudong International Airport in Shanghai, which will improve surveillance of movements within its airspace. It will also equip the international airports of Dalian and Shenyang with its advanced Surface Movement Guidance & Control System (A-SMGCS), which will include latest generation surface movement radars. 



The station that Indra will deploy at Pudong International Airport will feature a primary radar and a secondary mode S radar, meaning more flights can be managed with tighter security levels. Pudong is one of the fastest growing Chinese airports in terms of passenger numbers.



At the international airports of Dalian and Shenyang, Indra will deploy A-SMGCS systems that will make for more efficient control of aircraft runway maneuvers, and a flight platform, allowing operations to be conducted under poor visibility conditions.



These systems will be equipped with Indra's continuous wave surface radars, which offer high resolution detection and location of aircraft and other objects, whether stationary or in movement. 



The company already completed deployment of an initial A-SMGCS system at Guangzhou International Airport, which was the first in China to be equipped with a continuous wave surface radar.



The multinational has a solid position in the Chinese air traffic control systems market. It has deployed a network of fifty radars that controls 60% of airspace. The Chengdu and Xian control centers oversee air traffic in an area that covers 4.2 million km2 using the company's technology.

"SESAR members together with partners and the European Space Agency’s Iris Precursor have carried out a joint flight trial, successfully demonstrating that existing satellite technology systems are a viable option for air traffic services datalink. The trial showed for the first time how Iris Precursor technology can be used to provide end-to-end air–ground communications for initial '4D’ flight trajectory management, connecting aircraft and ATM ground systems to optimise the aircraft trajectory in four dimensions: latitude, longitude, altitude and time. The flight trial further confirms the benefits offered by i4D in terms of increased flight predictability and overall network efficiency.



Carried out by the members of the SESAR Joint Undertaking (SESAR JU)[1], the flight trial represents an important milestone in the continued collaboration[2] between satellite and ATM industries in Europe. The Iris Precursor is the denomination for datalink communications over the existing SwiftBroadband (SBB) satellite network from Inmarsat using the Aeronautical Telecommunication Network (ATN) as the standard protocol for the datalink services implementing rules. 

 

""The flight trial shows what can be achieved by joining forces on European aviation modernisation. The results are clearly in line with the SESAR vision of the future ATM system, as captured by the European ATM Master Plan,"" said Florian Guillermet, Executive Director of the SESAR JU.

 

The SESAR flight trial was performed on the 23 February 2016 on an Airbus A330 MSN871. The aircraft took off from Toulouse, flew over Baleares islands and came back to Toulouse passing above Madrid. During the flight, i4D Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Contract (ADS-C) reports and Controller Pilot Data Link Communication (CPDLC) exchanges were performed with the EUROCONTROL Maastricht Upper Area Control Centre (MUAC). It showed how ADS-C contracts could be successfully maintained with two air traffic control centres (MUAC and Airbus Toulouse) for over two hours. During this time, i4D ADS-C reports were generated on event resulting in downlinking trajectory updates approximatively every 20 seconds with 20 waypoints - an update rate which is well above the rate expected when initial 4D trajectory exchanges are implemented. In addition to the i4D trajectory exchanges, various CDPLC messages were exchanged along the flight with a remarkable performance rate round trip time of below two seconds throughout the flight’s duration.

 

The flight trial also tested the handover between the Inmarsat satellite spot beams, which were completely transparent from the perspective of on-board the aircraft. In terms of connectivity, the trial experienced no loss or provider aborts, a frequent issue with the existing VDL2 terrestrial datalink. Datalink is a key enabler for the SESAR vision, in particular, to implement 4D trajectory-based operations.  This flight trial demonstrates that with efficient data link services, flight plans can be continuously updated during a flight to maintain an optimal trajectory to destination, allowing air traffic control to offer better routings, sequence aircraft far in advance, and maximise airport and airspace capacity. It also confirms that the Iris Precursor services based on the Inmarsat legacy network can successfully complement the existing terrestrial VDL2 infrastructure.

 

By 2018, Iris Precursor is expected to support CPDLC in Europe and open the door to initial 4D trajectory management. In the longer term, Iris will evolve to support full 4D and operate in a highly secure multi-link environment with future terrestrial datalinks. The transition roadmap from Iris Precursor to the future communication infrastructure is currently being addressed by SESAR 2020 - the next wave of research and innovation activities by the SESAR JU - as well as by ESA and Inmarsat (Iris Service Evolution).

"The Thales (Euronext Paris: HO) Board of Directors met on 22 February 2016 to close the financial statements for the 2015 financial year4. 



Patrice Caine, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, stated: “2015 was an important milestone in the success of our profitable growth strategy. We achieved a record order intake, and our sales witnessed solid growth after several years of quasi-stability. Profitability increased in line with our medium-term objectives, while we increased our investments in innovation, marketing and talent development.” 



He added: “These good results strengthen our belief that Thales is now back on track to deliver sustainable growth. We are upgrading our organic sales growth target for the years ahead and confirm our margin target for 2017-2018. Thanks to the efforts of all its employees, Thales is undergoing a profound transformation which will foster profitable and sustainable growth.” 



Key figures 



The new orders booked in 2015 amounted to a record €18,880 million, representing an increase of 31% compared to 2014 (+28% at constant scope and exchange rates). In all business lines, commercial initiatives launched as part of the Ambition Boost plan have delivered. At 31 December 2015, the consolidated order book totalled €32,292 million, which represents some 2.3 years of sales, strengthening the visibility in terms of activity in the coming years.

Sales amounted to €14,063 million, up 8.4% on a reported basis, and up 4.5% at constant scope and exchange rates (“organic” change). Sales saw a slight upturn in growth on mature markets3 (organic growth of +0.5%) while emerging markets maintained a high level of growth (organic growth of +16%, after +12% in 2014). As a result, emerging markets represented 28% of 2015 Group sales, compared to 23% in 2013 and 25% in 2014.



For 2015, the Group reported an EBIT of €1,216 million, which represents 8.6% of sales, compared to €985 million (7.6% of sales) in 2014. EBIT was notably driven by a strong performance in the Defence and Security segment.



Hence, Thales exceeded all of the financial objectives set for 2015, which were to achieve a low-single digit increase in sales and a level of EBIT between €1,130 million and €1,150 million. 

The adjusted net income, Group share stood at €809 million, an increase of 44% which is mainly explained by the improvement in EBIT and a lower effective tax rate.

Cash indicators also witnessed a clear upturn, benefiting from the sharp rise in adjusted net income and advance payments received on orders placed during the year. Free operating cash-flow stood at €1,110 million, which represents a twofold increase compared to 2014. At 31 December 2015, net cash was €1,978 million, an increase of almost one billion euros compared to 31 December 2014.

In this context, the Board of Directors decided to propose the distribution of a dividend of €1.36 per share, an increase of more than 21% compared to 2014.



The new orders booked in 2015 amounted to €18,880 million, an increase of 31% compared to 2014 (+28% at constant scope and exchange rates1). The book-to-bill ratio was 1.34 for the 2015 financial year.





Thales also benefited from a particularly high number of large orders (with a unit value over €100 million): 24 large orders in all Group segments, following on from 19 in 2013 and 19 in 2014:

In 2015, the Group signed 5 “jumbo” contracts with a unit value over €500 million: the signalling for 4 lines of the London Underground network, orders relating to the acquisition of the Rafale fighter aircraft by Egypt and Qatar, the order for over 1,000 vehicles by the Australian Defense Force (""Hawkei""), and a military satellite communications system for France (ComSat NG). 



The positive dynamic order trend was not restricted to large contracts: orders with a unit value under €10 million were up 6% compared to 2014. From a geographical perspective1, orders were up sharply both in mature markets (€12,701 million, +26%, including France: +14%, United Kingdom: +68%, Australia/New Zealand: +58%) and in emerging markets (€6,179 million, +45%, including Asia: +17% and the Middle East: +93%). 



Order intake for the Aerospace segment rose sharply to €6,279 million, compared to €5,024 million in 2014 (+25%). Avionics orders increased, boosted by continued growth in commercial and military avionics, both original equipment and support. In the in-flight entertainment (IFE) business, the Group signed several large contracts, including with JetBlue, Singapore Airlines, Saudi Arabian Airlines and Japan Airlines. There was a strong commercial momentum in the Space business, in the institutional segment for observation, navigation and exploration satellites as well as in the telecommunications segment, with the signing of the previously mentioned large contracts. 



In the Transport segment, orders were up 71% on 2014, at €2,826 million, thanks in particular to the “jumbo” contract awarded by London Underground for the renovation of the signalling for four major lines on its network. 



Order intake in the Defence & Security segment totalled €9,704 million compared to €7,608 million in 2014 (+28%). As previously explained, this segment enjoyed numerous commercial successes in Land & Air Systems (provision of ""Hawkei"" light protected vehicles to the Australian Defense Force, the French army’s air defence system upgrade, optronics for “Scout” armoured vehicles in the UK, etc.) and in Defence Mission Systems (equipments for the Egyptian and Qatari Rafales, submarine systems…). Orders in the Secure Communications and Information Systems business line fell slightly, but remained above sales.



 





Sales for 2015 amounted to €14,063 million, compared to €12,974 million in 2014, up 8.4% on a reported basis1, and up 4.5% at constant scope and exchange rates (“organic” change), while in 2014, they fell organically by 1.1% compared to 2013. 



Geographically speaking2, this performance can be explained both by the return of organic growth in mature markets (+0.5%) and by continued solid growth in emerging markets (+16%, following on from +12% in 2014). 



In the Aerospace segment, sales amounted to €5,381 million, up 7.3% compared to 2014 (+1.7% at constant scope and exchange rates). The Avionics business continued to benefit from a favourable currency impact and the acquisition of Live TV, as well as the increased sales of commercial avionics and in-flight entertainment systems. However, sales of helicopter avionics and of tubes and imaging systems were down. Revenues in the Space business increased slightly, with the momentum in observation, exploration and navigation activities offsetting the fall in revenues seen from telecommunication satellites. 



In the Transport segment, sales amounted to €1,519 million, up 8.4% compared to 2014 (+4.1% at constant scope and exchange rates). Despite execution difficulties on a number of contracts, this segment returned to growth after two years of organic decline in sales, thanks to main line rail signalling, supervision, and especially urban rail signalling projects, which are growing once again. 



Sales in the Defence & Security segment reached €7,084 million, up 9.3% compared to 2014 (+6.8% at constant scope and exchange rates). All activities contributed to this positive trend. The Land & Air Systems business saw strong growth, specifically in missile systems, ""Bushmaster"" and ""Hawkei"" armoured vehicles, and civil and military radars. The Defence Mission Systems business benefited from the ramp-up of the SSOP (Sensors Support Optimisation Project) contract in the United Kingdom, and the start of the Rafale contract in Egypt. In addition to the good performance seen in cyber-security activities, the Secure Communications and Information Systems business did well in terms of radio-communications and started to book revenues on the Oman airports project.





Results 

For 2015, the Group reported an EBIT1 of €1,216 million, which represents 8.6% of sales, compared to €985 million (7.6% of sales) in 2014.

The EBIT for the Aerospace segment increased again to €518 million (9.6% of sales) compared to €505 million (10.1% of sales) in 2014. The EBIT margin, which reached a high level in 2014, was down slightly, due primarily to the effect of higher R&D spending. 



The Transport segment reported an EBIT of €-37 million (-2.4% of sales) compared to €32 million (2.3% of sales) in 2014. As part of the in-depth review of the contract portfolio carried out during the first half of 2015, additional charges were booked, which had a major impact on the profitability of this segment. In line with the recovery plan implemented by the new management team, this segment achieved breakeven in the second half of 2015 (+€2 million). After 2016, which should see break-even achieved, the impact of the recovery plan will allow this business to gradually return to profitability in the coming years. 



The EBIT for the Defence & Security segment increased significantly, totalling €760 million (10.7% of sales) compared to €620 million in 2014 (9.6% of sales). In addition to the very satisfactory level of contract execution, the rise in margins was driven by the healthy commercial dynamics, particularly in the Land & Air Systems and Secure Communications and Information Systems businesses. 



The contribution made by DCNS to EBIT stood at €22 million in 2015, compared with €-117 million in 2014. DCNS is implementing its recovery plan as expected. DCNS results in 2015 were a little higher than expected, mainly due to non-recurring items.

The amount of net financial interest remained low, at €4 million in 2015 compared to €2 million in 2014, while other adjusted financial results1 were improving (€-10 million in 2015 compared to €-27 million in 2014). Adjusted financial income on pensions and other employee benefits1 fared slightly better than in 2014 (€-73 million compared to €-77 million), since the discount rates at the end of 2014, which were used to determine the 2015 financial cost, were lower than the 2013 rates. The adjusted net income, Group share2 stood at €809 million, compared to €562 million in 2014, after an adjusted tax charge1 of €266 million compared to €258 million in 2014. The effective tax rate is 27%, compared to 29% in 2014. 



The adjusted net income, Group share, per share1 amounted to €3.89, up sharply on 2014 (€2.75). 



Financial position at 31 December 2015 



Free operating cash flow amounted to €1,110 million. It increased sharply compared to 2014 (€501 million), despite an increase in net operating investments (€458 million compared to €443 million in 2014) as part of the optimisation of the Group’s industrial base. Above and beyond the improvement in EBIT, it benefited from advance payments received on orders recorded during the year. 



At 31 December 2015, net cash amounted to €1,978 million compared to €1,006 million at the end of December 2014. The acquisition of Vormetric, announced in October 2015, is expected to be completed in the first half of 2016. 



Equity, Group share, stood at €4,646 million compared to €3,782 million at the end of December 2014, due primarily to consolidated net income, Group share, of €765 million. 



Proposed dividend 



At the Annual General Meeting on 18 May 2016, the Board of directors will propose the distribution of a dividend of €1.36 per share to the shareholders, an increase of 21% on 2014. If approved, the ex-dividend date will be 30 May 2016 and the payment date will be 1st June 2016. The dividend will be paid fully in cash and will amount to €1.01 per share, after deducting the interim dividend of €0.35 per share already paid in December 2015.





Outlook 



After the record level seen in 2015, new orders are expected to remain high in 2016, close to the level observed in 2013-20141. Sales should see a mid-single digit organic growth compared to 2015. 



This positive trend, combined with continuing efforts to improve competitiveness, should result in Thales posting an EBIT between €1,300 and €1,330 million (based on exchange rates in February 2016), which will represent an increase between 7% and 9% compared to 2015. 

In this context, Thales is upgrading its medium-term sales growth target. The Group is now aiming for mid-single digit organic growth in 2017 and 2018. It also confirms its EBIT margin target of 9.5 to 10% in the same time frame.",air-traffic
"Frequentis was awarded the contract to develop a cross-layer Quality-of-Service (QoS) routing testbed for hybrid (terrestrial-satellite) networks. The results will enable satellite service providers to offer flexible and dynamic services for different users and networks, allowing seamless integration into hybrid IP networks and increasing availability of service.

Frequentis is actively participating in research programmes to develop and evaluate future technical concepts. In this case the company brings its expertise in design, integration and operation of air traffic management networks focusing on IP-based end-to-end network solutions for safety-critical applications.

For the ARTES (Advanced Research in Telecommunications Systems) programme of the European Space Agency (ESA) Frequentis was awarded the contract to develop a cross-layer Quality-of-Service (QoS) routing testbed for hybrid networks. It enables the evaluation of different routing algorithms, network performance measurements and link supervision. For safety-critical networks, such as ATM-grade networks, parallel routing paths and mobility of services are important. Considering real-time information of the actual network performance allows for preventing failures in network links before occurring.

“To integrate satellite and terrestrial networks into a single backbone infrastructure for all applications – operational as well as administrative – is challenging. Every application has different performance needs. The characteristics of satellite and terrestrial networks are completely different: satellite band-width is very expensive but available everywhere, latencies are higher but more stable and routing protocols and timings need to be aligned. Information from multiple network layers (cross-layer) for a QoS-based routing is essential for ATM-grade network performance”, explains Stefan Galler, Product Manager for ATM networks at Frequentis.

With its ARTES programme, ESA ensures that investment in space deliver benefits to all citizens and is coordinating the financial and intellectual resources of its members to support programmes and activities across countries. The goal is to develop successful commercial products deriving from this flexible framework of activities.

The ARTES 5.1 activities in which Frequentis is participating are dedicated to “Advanced technology” to generate long-term technological deployments based on an annually established work plan. This assignment is another opportunity for Frequentis to showcase its expertise in IP and end-to-end ATM-grade network solutions which enable cost-effective scaling. To deliver end-to-end performance for every application requires the combination of real-time network performance monitoring and multi-technology networks.",air-traffic
"The European Commission has awarded aviation consultancy Helios a four-year framework contract of up to EUR 10 million to support the work of three groups key to the implementation of the Single European Sky (SES): the Industry Consultation Body (ICB), the NSA Coordination Platform (NCP) and the Expert Group on the Social Dimension of SES (EGSD). The contract comes at a critical time in policy development for SES, when innovation and ongoing commitment are needed to tackle priority SES topics such as the evolution of the Performance Scheme, the deployment of SESAR, technical challenges such as RPAS and cyber-security, and the revision of the regulatory framework for safety.

Commenting on the win, Paul Ravenhill, Technical Director for Helios, said: “This continues and extends our long-standing work for the ICB, and is testament to the job we have done for them over the last ten years. We are immensely proud of our staff who, every day, are engaged in ATM strategy and policy work covering operational, technical and economic matters. As a consultancy we work hard to maintain our independence, and this will be a key factor of our support function.”

In accordance with the requirement of the call, bringing the support functions together under one contract will help to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the support provided. This will minimise duplication of effort in administrative and technical areas and provide opportunities for innovation. The Helios offer elaborates on this and contains a well thought-out approach to consensus building among members of the individual groups and a clear strategy for furthering the work of each group.",air-traffic
"Last year, the air traffic volume in FABEC airspace increased by 1.8 percent from 5,512,253 flights in 2014 to 5,612,328 flights in 2015. Landings in the FABEC area grew by 1.1 percent in 2015 compared with 2014. The growth trend has now continued for the second consecutive year. For the first time, almost all FABEC control centres recorded a traffic increase in 2015. Nevertheless, there are still some significant variations between control centres and individual sectors. Moreover, when the long-term trend is considered, traffic volume is still below the values seen in 2007.

Less encouraging are the numbers for overall operational performance, which experienced a decline last year. The 2015 en-route ATFM delay per flight (all causes) was 0.70 minutes per flight compared with 0.56 minutes per flight in 2014. The target of 0.48 minutes of average ATFM delay per flight set out in the FABEC performance plan was not met. These values incorporate delay due to all possible causes including capacity and weather.

The en-route ATFM delay caused by ANSPs came in at 0.48 minutes per flight. This represents a deterioration in performance compared with the previous year (0.31 minutes per flight) and exceeds the target value of 0.37 minutes per flight. The main reasons for this development were local issues, such as capacity shortages and the introduction of new technical systems. Active countermeasures are being taken that include the shifting of traffics flows, improving air traffic flow and capacity management measures, and re-sectorisation.

The strong influence of the weather is reflected in arrival delay in particular. Inclement weather was the cause of 58.7 percent of all delays. This explains why arrival delay experienced a 14 percent year-on-year rise. Looking only at the delays caused by ATC, on the other hand, an improvement of 17 percent can be seen.Across FABEC, only 227,000 of the 2.055 million minutes of arrival delay were related to factors that can be influenced by air navigation service providers.",air-traffic
